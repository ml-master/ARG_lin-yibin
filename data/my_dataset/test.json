One of them included Malakar's hair.\n\nLater, Malakar himself came out! Kimmel said he thought Clay Aiken was supposed to be in there too, but Malakar said he ate him.\n\nAt the end of the sketch, Kimmel told Malakar to get back in and to put his hair back on \"so everyone will know who the hell you are.\"\n\nThe segment also included an appearance from Ashley Ferl, best known as the \"crying girl.\" Ferl famously broke into tears when Malakar performed \"You Really Got Me,\" and became an early viral video star in 2007.\n\nMalakar famously made it to seventh place on Idol's sixth season, much to the chagrin of Simon Cowell and the other judges. Still, he is a fan-favorite, as made clear by the reactions from viewers on Twitter.\n\n\"Other than the bald head, Sanjaya didn't look like he aged at all. And that crying girl still looks like a girl in spite of being a grown woman now,\" one fan wrote.\n\nOther than the bald head, Sanjaya didn't look like he aged at all.

That series was eyed to launch in either 2018 or 2019, after Benioff and Weiss completed their work on the final season of Thrones.\n\nWith the delay of Thrones\u2018 final season as well as their involvement in Star Wars \u2014 for which there is no timetable \u2014 the future of the project remains murky. HBO did not immediately respond for comment on the future of Confederate.\n\nDuring a Disney earnings call Tuesday, Disney CEO Bob Iger said talks with Benioff and Weiss, repped by CAA, had been ongoing \u201cfor a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have an idea for number of films and at some later date I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll disclose to all of you just what those are,\u201d Iger said. \u201cThey are focused on a point in time in the Star Wars mythology and taking it from there.\u201d\n\nNext up on the docket for Lucasfilm is Solo: A Star Wars Story (due out May 25), followed by Episode IX (Dec. 20, 2019).",

DeMille award for lifetime achievement at this year\u2019s Golden Globes. During her speech, Winfrey recalled watching Sidney Poitier win at the Golden Globes for 1964\u2019s Lilies of the Field and how it was the first time she saw a black man celebrated on television. \u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that at this moment, there are little girls watching as I become the first black woman to receive this award,\u201d Winfrey said.\n\nMaking a plea for a free press, Winfrey said, \u201cI want to say I value the press more than ever before as we try to navigate these complicated times. Which brings me to this: What I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have. I\u2019m especially proud and inspired by all the women who felt strong enough and empowered enough to speak up and share their personal stories.\u201d\n\nMen and women at Sunday\u2019s Golden Globes showed remarkable solidarity in protesting sexual harassment and sexual assault in Hollywood and the world at large, promoting the new Time\u2019s Up initiative and also wearing black to express unity.\n\n\u201cThis year, we became the story. But it\u2019s not just a story affecting the entertainment industry, it\u2019s one that transcends any culture or workplace,\u201d Winfrey said, before noting that sexual misconduct affects women and men in industries that stretch beyond Hollywood.\n\nWinfrey then pivoted her speech by telling the story of Recy Taylor, who was raped by a group of white men in Alabama in 1944.\n\n\u201cRecy Taylor died 10 days ago. She lived too many years in a culture broken by brutally powerful men. Women were not believed,\u201d Winfrey said, before adding to the abusive men, \u201ctheir time is up.\u201d\n\nWinfrey closed her speech with a call for unity: \u201cI want all the girls watching to know a new day is on the horizon. And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure they are the leaders to take us to the time where nobody has to say \u2018me too\u2019 again.\u201d\n\nTo donate to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which will provide subsidized legal support to women and men in all industries who have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or abuse in the workplace, visit its GoFundMe page. Learn more about Time\u2019s Up, an organization of women in entertainment combating sexual harassment and inequality, on its website.\n\nBackstage after her speech, Winfrey added of the Globes red carpet protest, where attendees wore all-black outfits to the ceremony, \u201cI thought here is an opportunity for a powerful growth and how do we use this moment to elevate what is happening instead of continually victimize ourselves. And so I think wearing black in solidarity is one step. I think what Time\u2019s Up is doing with legal defense fund is a major step. It was very important to all of us that it not just be about the women of Hollywood, but to extend to the women of the world because there isn\u2019t a culture, a religion, a workplace, that hasn\u2019t been effected by it. And one of the reasons I wanted to tell Recy Taylor\u2019s story is because it\u2019s been going on for a very long time. There are so many women who\u2019ve endured so much and remained silent and kept going because there was no other recourse and now that we\u2019ve all joined as one voice, I think it feels like empowerment to those women who\u2019ve never had it.\u201d\n\nFor years, Winfrey was known as the queen of the daytime talk show with The Oprah Winfrey Show, which ran for 25 seasons from September 8, 1986, to May 25, 2011, while also scoring lead roles in critically acclaimed movies \u2014 many of which she also produced. In 1985, she costarred in Steven Spielberg\u2019s The Color Purple, a role for which she received a Golden Globe nomination. In 1998, she produced and starred in the movie adaptation of Toni Morrison\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, Beloved, and later in Lee Daniels\u2019 The Butler and Ava DuVernay\u2019s Selma. She is also the chairman and CEO of the cable network, OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network, and founder of O, The Oprah Magazine.\n\nWinfrey\u2019s charitable endeavors include establishing The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa to provide education for girls from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nThe philanthropist returns to the big screen in March 2018 with the upcoming Disney adaptation of Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s sci-fi novel A Wrinkle in Time, in which she costars alongside Mindy Kaling and Reese Witherspoon.\n\nWinfrey is the first black woman to earn the Cecil B.

Gunn has been an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe offensive attitudes and statements discovered on James\u2019 Twitter feed are indefensible and inconsistent with our studio\u2019s values, and we have severed our business relationship with him,\u201d Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn said in a statement Friday.\n\nOn Thursday, Gunn tweeted in response to the tweets being resurfaced, \u201cMany people who have followed my career know, when I started, I viewed myself as a provocateur, making movies and telling jokes that were outrageous and taboo. As I have discussed publicly many times, as I\u2019ve developed as a person, so has my work and my humor.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not to say I\u2019m better, but I am very, very different than I was a few years ago; today I try to root my work in love and connection and less in anger. My days saying something just because it\u2019s shocking and trying to get a reaction are over.\u201d\n\nThe offensive tweets came to light after conservative website The Daily Caller dug up the social media posts, which were mostly posted in 2008 and 2009. Soon after, conservative personalities were tweeting to followers to confront Gunn at Comic-Con. Gunn had been expected to be at Sony\u2019s presentation on Friday. Insiders say Gunn is not expected to be part of the panel now.\n\nGunn issued a statement on Friday afternoon, saying that he \u201cregretted\u201d the tweets in question and stressed that \u201cthey don\u2019t reflect the person I am today.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy words of nearly a decade ago were, at the time, totally failed and unfortunate efforts to be provocative,\u201d his statement read. \u201cI have regretted them for many years since \u2014 not just because they were stupid, not at all funny, wildly insensitive, and certainly not provocative like I had hoped, but also because they don\u2019t reflect the person I am today or have been for some time.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cRegardless of how much time has passed, I understand and accept the business decisions taken today. Even these many years later, I take full responsibility for the way I conducted myself then. All I can do now, beyond offering my sincere and heartfelt regret, is to be the best human being I can be: accepting, understanding, committed to equality, and far more thoughtful about my public statements and my obligations to our public discourse. To everyone inside my industry and beyond, I again offer my deepest apologies. Love to all.\u201d\n\nGunn has been writing the script for Guardians 3, and the movie was expected to begin shooting in Atlanta in the fall for an expected 2020 release date, though Marvel Studios had never officially announced the date. The Guardians movies have been a massive success for Disney and Marvel. The first movie made more than $773 million worldwide while the second made $863 million. The films stood out from other Marvel movies as they were infused with Gunn\u2019s off-kilter filmmaking sensibilities that owed more to indie genre movies than slicker cookie-cutter studio fare. Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige had previously indicated that Gunn would continue to work with Marvel after Guardians 3, helping shepherd the cosmic side of the studio\u2019s universe.",

At a premiere last night, Garfield ended up gushing about Stone when E! asked Garfield if he had seen Stone's film Battle of the Sexes. \"I haven't [seen the movie] but I'm very excited to,\" he started. The reporter then asked if there was any friendly competition between the two, as they both have films out (Breathe for Garfield). \"Oh my god, no, don't be silly,\" he immediately dismissed. \"I'm nothing but supportive and her biggest fan.\"\n\nStone and her biggest fan boy may be able to see each other a little more easily in the coming months. Angels in America, Garfield's last theater project in London, will be doing a New York City Broadway run that he'll be participating in, starting in February (though rehearsals could begin well before).

    "content": "Photo: Michael Becker/FOX\n\nIt\u2019s official: Fox is done trying to scare up viewers for Scream Queens. The network confirmed Monday what had been obvious for months, namely that the Ryan Murphy\u2013produced horror anthology wouldn\u2019t be returning next season. The scrawled-in-pig\u2019s-blood handwriting had been on the wall for the series since last fall. Despite a small, passionate core audience of viewers under 34, the series\u2019 overall ratings were simply too low to justify renewal. Scream Queens didn\u2019t do very well in the Nielsen ratings during its first season, and collapsed even further last fall, losing about half of its already small audience. Fox will still be in business with Murphy, however: The prolific producer is working on a new first-responder drama, 9-1-1, starring Angela Bassett. It\u2019s expected to premiere in early 2018. What\u2019s more, even if Scream Queens is now dead at Fox, the anthology nature of the series means it would be very easy for Murphy to resurrect the concept down the road, either at Fox or another network. In TV these days, just as in most horror movies, nothing is ever really dead. Case in point: Fox says it\u2019s not yet ready to say 24: Legacy or Prison Break are done for. While the latter revival won\u2019t be back next season, Fox says another round of Prison could be green-lit in the future. As for the new 24, despite disappointing ratings, Fox is planning to talk to co-creator Howard Gordon over the summer, before making any official verdict on the show\u2019s fate.",

    "content": "Fuller House actress Jodie Sweetin has obtained a restraining order against her ex, Justin Hodak. Sweetin, 35, and Hodak, 40, just broke up after a year long engagement and Sweetin went on to get a restraining order. The court order required Hodak to stay 100 yards away from her, her job, her home, her children\u2019s school and her vehicle. It also prohibited Hodak from contacting Sweetin in any way whether directly or indirectly.\n\nHodak arrested\n\nThe ex-fianc\u00e9 clearly could not adhere to the restraining order and was arrested at Sweetin\u2019s Sherman Oaks home in Carlifonia on Monday. It was merely days after the actress got the restraining order when Hodak showed up at her home. Sweetin called the police when she saw a suspicious vehicle outside her home and the cops swung in and arrested Hodak from his car. It was the second time he was arrested in a week as he was previously caught for unlawful possession of a firearm, as a convicted felon Hodak is not allowed to possess a rifle.\n\nRaging arguments fractured their relationship\n\nThe two had a heated fight earlier on in the month that prompted Sweetin to call off the engagement. The fight, that estranged the two lovers, was escalated by Hodak\u2019s rage. He was using testosterone supplements and steroids that were saidb to have fuelled his anger. The court documents had some revealing information stating that Hodak was abusing alcohol and marijuana on the said day. In the documents, Hodak supposedly threatened to commit suicide if Sweetin made him leave. Hodak left the house a while later armed with a 9mm pistol.\n\nThe court documents also state that Hodak had confessed to Sweetin about a drug problem and incarceration due to felony offences such as assault with a deadly weapon so as to support the habit. Hodak kept pestering the actress and made 87 phone calls just between the time of the break up and obtaining of the Emergency Protective Order. In addition to this, he also threatened to sell compromising photos of Sweetin which he keeps on his phone.\n\nA narrative of abuse\n\nIn the documents, Jodie Sweetin also admits to abuse on various other altercations. The two lovers often had arguments where Hodak would throw things at Sweetin. At one time, during a previous break-up, Hodak followed Sweetin to Burbank at the Warner Bros. studios demanding to talk to her where he got into a push and shove with the security guards. In another incidence, Hodak waited for the actress outside her children\u2019s school for a confrontation.\n\nJodie Sweetin stated, through her spokesperson, that she would appreciate privacy at this time. The scary situation has not been fully settled, however, Sweetin\u2019s restraining order offers protection to people close to her including; her parents, daughters and assistant.",

ABC has just announced that two ladies from the current season who were, as you might say, \"gone too soon,\" will be on Bachelor Winter Games (supervising producer: Lindsay Liles), which airs in Feb. Yes, that's right: Bibiana and Lauren G. have joined the Winter Games cast, which already has a stacked list of Bachelor Nation members. While the whole cast of the Olympics-inspired new show offers reason enough for excitement, the truth is, Bibiana's return to Bachelor Nation might be the most exciting news of all.\n\nHer run on Season 22 was short \u2014 she only lasted three episodes \u2014 but impactful. In the third episode, Bibiana made a compelling case for why she should remain on TV. Even though Arie eliminated her, she tried to maneuver a one-on-one date with her love interest, which didn't quite go as planned. After setting up a couch and telescope outside in the driveway \u2014 the most romantic gesture ever, probably \u2014 the \"love trap,\" as you might call it, ended up hosting a romantic moment between Arie and Lauren B. INSTEAD. When Bibiana tried to break up their date at the spot she set up, Arie asked her for five more minutes with Lauren B. Ouch.\n\nAfter her elimination, Bibiana tearfully said that she wants \"everyone to know\" that she tried. Watching her do so, and cry the whole time while doing it, was highly entertaining for Bachelor fans. As a promo clip for Winter Games suggests, the new show will likely present more of the same \u2014 which is exactly what everyone wants.\n\nAs mentioned before, Bibiana won't be the only Season 22 contestant to return for Winter Games. Lauren G., who was eliminated at the end of the second episode, will also return. While Lauren G. didn't quite make as great of an impact as Bibi, her time on The Bachelor was undoubtedly cut too short. She didn't stand much of a chance, what with so many \"Laurens\" competing for Arie's affection. The fact that she'll get to have another chance at friendly competition is a reason for celebration. And the Winter Games competition already sounds pretty intense.\n\nThe new Bachelor spin-off, which will premiere on Feb. 13 has a loaded cast from all over the world. Yes, in the spirit of the 2018 Winter Olympics, the Bachelor's new show includes cast members both from the U.S. and other countries' Bachelor seasons. As for the U.S. contestants, fan-favorites like Ashley Iaconetti and Dean \"Deanie Baby\" Unglert will get another chance at love, all while competing in athletic challenges. It's gonna be intense.\n\nAs for the international contestants, Winter Games will host Ally Thompson of The Bachelor New Zealand, Nastassia Yaramchuk from Sweden, Japan's Yuki Kimura, Christian Rauch representing Switzerland and Germany, and many more. If you're not familiar with any of these people, fear not, as you'll probably soon know everything about them, from their athletic abilities to their hot-tub temperature preferences.\n\nThe Bachelor Winter Games promises to turn up the heat during the coldest months of the year, and it's probably going to be as thrilling, if not more, than the real Olympics. If there's anything that Bachelor Nation has taught everyone, it's that love is a game and the competition is fierce. Even though Bibiana and Lauren G. didn't have much luck with Arie, at least they get another shot at love and victory. And they'll have plenty more opportunity to cry on camera, which Bibiana will most definitely take advantage of. What a time to be alive.",

Gerber dropped the jaw-dropping tidbit during his appearance on MSNBC's Headliners.\n\n... And the amazing monetary gift wasn't all. Gerber said that Clooney also paid his friends' taxes for the year.\n\n\"There\u2019s a group of guys we call 'The Boys,'\" Gerber shared. \"George had called me and 'The Boys' and said, 'Hey, mark September 27th, 2013, on your calendar. Everyone\u2019s going to come to my house for dinner.'\"\n\nAt the dinner, Clooney's pals were surprised with designer luggage bags at each seat on the table -- each containing a million dollars in $20 bills. Gerber noted that not all of the actor's friends were rich, with some struggling to support their families.\n\n\"George begins to say, 'Listen, I want you guys to know how much you've meant to me and how much you mean to me in my life,'\" Gerber recalled. \"'I came to L.A., I slept on your couch. I'm so fortunate in my life to have all of you and I couldn't be where I am today without all of you. So, it was really important to me that while we\u2019re still all here together, that I give back. So I want you all to open your suitcases.'\"\n\nNot surprisingly, Gerber said he and the actor's pals were \"in shock.\"\n\n\"Every one of us -- 14 of us -- got a million dollars,\" he marveled. \"Every single one of us. We're in shock. Like, what is this? He goes, 'I know we've all been through some hard times, some of you are still going through it. You don't have to worry about your kids, you don't have to worry about, you know, school, you don't have to worry about paying your mortgage.'\"\n\n\"I mean these are guys that took care of George and now he\u2019s giving it all back,\" Gerber added. \"And George said, 'Not only that, I have paid everyone's taxes so this million dollars is yours.'\"\n\nGerber -- who is independently wealthy -- said he insisted on not accepting the gift, but Clooney refused. The businessman said he ended up donating his million dollars to charity.\n\nAlthough, Gerber noted that Clooney may have gotten his own reward for his generous gift.\n\n\"That was September 27th, 2013. Now September 27, 2014, he marries Amal,\" he pointed out. \"That's good karma right there.\"\n\nIn October, Gerber hosted an epic Casamigos Halloween party, escorting both his wife, supermodel Cindy Crawford, and Amal Clooney.\n\nWatch below:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:",

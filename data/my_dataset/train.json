The 35-year-old, Texas-based contestant from Lorenzo Borghese\u2019s season of the show was known for being the center of attention (and, at the time, for exclusively wearing tiaras), and although she didn\u2019t win Borghese\u2019s final rose, she went on to appear on several Bachelor specials and on seasons two and three of Bachelor Pad. And now, the life coach and mother of one has found her true love \u2014 Rose was married over the weekend in Houston, Texas to fianc\u00e9 Charles Sanders! And both the wedding and the events leading up to it were in true Erica Rose form (that is, fit for a Texan princess). From the star\u2019s two gowns to her multiple showers, here\u2019s everything you need to know about her over-the-top nuptials.\n\nRose wore two wedding gowns: the first, a plunging white lace dress from Ventura\u2019s Bridal Fashions, for the ceremony (above); and then a custom blush lace number with a see-through panel designed by her \u201cfriend and fashionista Alex Martinez,\u201d for the reception.\n\n2. Several members of Bachelor Nation were there to celebrate the big day, including Rose\u2019s former suitor Borghese, Vienna Girardi,Ashlee Frazier Williams and Renee Simlak.\n\n3. Rose\u2019s one-year-old daughter Holland Rose Gentry (from a previous relationship) had a role in the ceremony. \u201cShe loved it too,\u201d Rose captioned her sweet Instagram shot.\n\n4. The bride\u2019s mother wore\u2026 white! Rose clearly wasn\u2019t afraid to let her mom, who wore a black-and-white color-block gown, shine too on the big day.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: Look Back at Every Wedding Dress From The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise\n\n5. Sanders wore a hot pink yarmulke, and the couple was married under a flower-adorned chuppah at Congregation Emanu El in Houston.\n\n6. The couple had a Kimye-esque rose wall that spelled out \u201cCherica,\u201d which also served as the wedding hashtag.\n\n7. There was also a step-and-repeat.\n\n8. The bride went back to her roots, wearing a jeweled tiara for the big day.\n\n9. She also wore a tiara at her bachelorette party\u2026 although it was decidedly more, well, bachelorette-y. \u201cShe was just a girl with a dream of wearing her own Pink Peen Tiara One Day,\u201d Rose commented on an Instagram snap with her new accessory.\n\n10. Rose also had a lingerie shower before the wedding, where friends and fans got to shop for underpinnings and indulge in bridal-themed pastries.\n\n11. There was also on-site Botox at the shower, for $10 a pop.\n\n12. The couple had several movie-themed wedding shoots prior to the wedding, inspired by everything from Clueless to American Wedding.\n\nWhat was your favorite part of Rose\u2019s wedding weekend?",

There\u2019s an natural inclination toward building out your closet in these months, adding more layers and extra insulation \u2014 but you\u2019d be doing yourself a favor to take just the opposite approach. Simplifying your cold-weather wardrobe down to a go-to rotation of wardrobe essentials for winter can make your life \u2014 or at least getting dressed in the morning \u2014 considerably easier. Trust.\n\nIf this seems a daunting or undesirable task (editing down is always harder than building out), take a tip from the experts: Celebrity stylist Mimi Cuttrell has a keen understanding of how to put together an ultra-chic winter outfit, whether the overall aesthetic skews more sporty, sophisticated, or trendy.

Always,\" Cuttrell says. \"You can never go wrong with a simple oversized cashmere sweater (The Row has the best!) and your favorite pair of denim.

Then, find a pair of soft pants that are comfy but not sloppy looking. A cozy sweater and an on-trend puffer coat are must-have pieces for this year in particular. Finish with a couple pairs of boots and some chic accessories to polish it all off, and you\u2019ll be prepped for practically any day-to-day styling situation from November through March.

It was 13 years of getting it, and then, one day you get it\u201d and then you start thinking \u2018This is my life\u2019s dream, what am I going to do after this?\u2019 It\u2019s always in the back of your mind,\u201d Moynihan said.\n\n\u201cI knew my contract was ending.

He remembered thinking, \u201cI\u2019ve got to make a decision soon\u201d whether to \u201chang out at the place I love most, or try and become an adult and move on.\u201d\n\nAsked why he left SNL when the show is on fire thanks to Donald Trump, Moynihan said, \u201cI felt like I was on one show for eight years and another for one year. It was a completely different machine last year, took on a whole different level.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get so used to never sleeping and writing all night long, and I made it through eight years of this, thinking this can\u2019t get any worse. And then, all of a sudden Trump happens\u2026With Trump you would come in on Friday and he did something nuts, and we\u2019d have to re-do everything. At times we were doing a brand new cold open on Saturday.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m so thankful I was there for that year. My first episode was the first time Tina [Fey] did Sarah Palin. And I was in the audience for Sean Spicer, when Melissa [McCarthy] did that.\u201d Moynihan called it \u201cthe hardest year easily\u201dof SNL, \u201cbut also, weirdly, maybe deep down one of my favorites. I was glad I got to be there for it.\u201d\n\nWritten by Dan Kopelman, Me, Myself & I examines one man\u2019s life over a 50-year span. The show will focus on three distinct periods in Alex Riley\u2019s life: as a 14-year-old in 1991 (Jack Dylan), a 40-year-old in present day (Moynihan), and a 65-year-old in 2042 (John Larroquette).\n\nEP Dan Kopelman said he never considered having Moynihan play the two adult roles. \u201cIt was always going to be three actors playing the same role and get the best actors for the role and trust that the audience is going to go along for the ride.\n\nLaroquette being much taller than Moynihan, \u201cin the future scenes we tried to surround [Laroquette] with taller people so he is not towering over them.\u201d But Moynihan and Larroquette are never seen together on screen, Kopelman reminded. \u201cIf we do our job right, you\u2019re going to go along for the ride.\u201d",

        "content": "There\u2019s a good chance you never expected to Google: \u201cHow to remove a poop stain from [fill in the blank].\u201d That\u2019s because when you imagined having a baby or a pet, you probably didn\u2019t envision leaky diapers and dog accidents \u2014 or the need to clean poop out of carpet or off of your favorite work clothes. But here you are, and you need to know how to clean these things properly.\n\nGetting rid of poop isn\u2019t fun, but it\u2019s not hard, either. (Unless the poop isn\u2019t hard \u2026 then it\u2019s hard. Breastfed-baby poop, anyone?)\n\nStart with the basics\n\nRemoving poop usually involves a two-step process. Here\u2019s what to do:\n\nCleaning.\n\nSanitizing or disinfecting.\n\nCleaning comes first because it\u2019s hard to disinfect something that hasn\u2019t been cleaned properly. This means getting rid of the bulk of the poop \u2014 whatever you can scrape off or otherwise remove \u2014 and washing the item or surface so that you can begin disinfecting (killing the germs).\n\nBut, should you wash the item with warm water or cold water? Depends. If it\u2019s a fabric that could potentially be stained, initially wash with cold water to avoid setting the stain. Warm water can be used if you\u2019re not worried about a permanent stain.\n\nTo quickly clean your basic fabric items (like a stained onesie that has those tell-tale yellow leaks streaking from the seams of the diaper area) follow these steps:\n\nRemove as much of the poop as you can (and work as quickly as possible; cleaning immediately can minimize the potential for staining).\n\nRinse or soak with cold water (blotting helps).\n\nWash in the washing machine using hot water, an enzyme-based cleaner (if suitable for the fabric) and bleach or vinegar (if suitable for the fabric).\n\nLearn to tackle stains on common fabrics and materials\n\nBaby and pet poop can affect any manner of objects from upholstery and carpeting to bedding, silk items, wool sweaters, your baby\u2019s toys, your dog\u2019s bed and on and on. The precise methods of cleaning will depend on the object that\u2019s involved, so try these tricks for specific materials:\n\nCotton\n\nPlastic\n\nFor baby toys and other plastic items, start with hot, soapy water and wash the affected item. Follow up by sanitizing or disinfecting (the Environmental Protection Agency offers a helpful PDF that explains proper procedure for sanitizing and disinfecting children\u2019s toys).\n\nRugs and carpeting\n\nFor your basic baby-poop-on-the-carpet event, clean with a combination of liquid dish soap, warm water and lots of blotting. Vinegar may prove helpful for stain-fighting. For a more complicated dog-poop-on-the-carpet event, a product called Nature\u2019s Miracle (an enzyme-based cleaner) may be effective at removing stains and odors.\n\nYour hands\n\nYou\u2019ve washed your hands repeatedly, but they STILL smell like poop. (It\u2019s OK, we\u2019ve all been there.) Washing your hands with liquid dish soap may help, or trying wiping your hands with rubbing alcohol swabs.\n\nSilk\n\nThe process of cleaning silk is similar to that of cleaning cotton except that you\u2019ll want to avoid enzyme-based cleaners. Sunshine is also recommended for stain removal on silk items.\n\nUpholstery\n\nCleaning upholstery can be similar to cleaning carpeting although initially treating with cold water is preferable to warm water if you want to avoid setting stains. For machine-washable sofa covers, follow up by laundering. Nature\u2019s Miracle may also be effective in the case of pet poop on your furniture.\n\nWool\n\nA cold-water soak is recommended for wool items. Then follow up with a thorough washing (avoid enzyme-based cleaners for wool products). Sunshine can be a good choice for removing stains from wool items.\n\nKeep these items on hand\n\nPaper towels\n\nPerfect for cleaning and disinfecting \u2014 paper towels are a lifesaver.\n\nRubber gloves\n\nEspecially helpful when cleaning dog poop. Plastic gloves eliminate the chance of getting poop on your hands, which is aways a plus!\n\nPatience\n\nRemoving stains takes time. Don\u2019t rush the process.\n\nA sense of humor\n\nRemember, this will be funny someday.\n\nA garbage can\n\nThere will come a time (and you\u2019ll know when) that an item is simply too gross to save \u2014 not recommended for the disposal of sofas.\n\nBonus cheat sheet of poop-removal and cleaning tips",

Gossip Cop reports that an insider close to Swift confirmed she is not house-searching in England at all\u2014especially as she's about to set off on her Reputation world tour this spring.\n\nOriginal, 4/5, 5:35 p.m.: Taylor Swift, the pop star and very secretive girlfriend of British actor Joe Alwyn, is ready to commit! To England full-time, that is. The Sun's Dan Wootton\u2014the guy who broke the news the two were secretly dating last May\u2014reports that Swift is looking for a North London house to make her home base. Alwyn and his family live in North London's Crouch End; Swift would like to be near that and the countryside near Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, outside of the city. (Soho Farmhouse, by the way, is where Meghan Markle had her swanky bridal shower.)\n\n\u201cTaylor loves the UK and how she can live a relatively normal life without being disturbed,\" the source said. The Sun previously reported that Swift went undetected in disguises around the city. \u201cSetting down roots is something she\u2019s thought long and hard about. She\u2019s set aside \u00a330 million ($42 million) to find the house of her dreams, which she hopes to one day settle down in with Joe if their relationship continues to grow.\"\n\nThe leading requirement for this house is that it has multiple kitchens. \u201cTwo mega kitchens are an absolute requirement as she wants one near her entertaining area to be kept clean,\" the source continued. This is because Swift loves cooking oh-so much. Her passion for it is so intense, Alwyn reportedly calls her his \"feeder,\" per The Sun.\n\nThis isn't Swift's only property, of course. Swift has a penthouse apartment in New York City, a Beverly Hills house that's also a historic landmark, the Rhode Island beach house where she throws her Fourth of July parties, and a penthouse apartment in Nashville (plus a house there, too).\n\nPreviously, Swift rented a home in London, then started staying at Alwyn's so much that his friends joked \"it\u2019s as if she\u2019s moved in with him,\" a source told The Sun earlier this year.",

Actress Scarlett Johansson, giving her second barn-burning speech at a Women\u2019s March in as many years, called out Globe winner James Franco on Saturday saying: \u201cI want my pin back, by the way.\u201d\n\nIn addition to winning a Golden Globe two weeks ago, Franco, who wore a Time\u2019s Up pin while claiming his prize, also garnered a lot of attention thanks to some comments on social media during the ceremony including some pointed, since-deleted tweets from actress Ally Sheedy. A few days later, the L.A. Times printed a report of five women accusing Franco of sexual misconduct. Franco denied the allegations. The actor has now been publicly addressed by Johansson, one of the original signers of the Time\u2019s Up announcement letter and a major donor to the cause.\n\nThough she didn\u2019t name him directly during her speech in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday, a rep for Johansson later confirmed to the L.A. Times that the actress was indeed referring directly to Franco when she said: \u201cHow could a person publicly stand by an organization that helps to provide support for victims of sexual assault while privately preying on people who have no power?\u201d Pausing for effect, she then asked Franco for her pin back. Her comments start at the 1:25 mark.\n\nJohansson posed further questions on much-debated topics such as abuses of power and what some deem grey areas of consent before saying she felt a \u201crage\u201d bubbling up inside her on behalf of women who have been abused and also, she admitted, on behalf of herself.\n\nJohansson then related her own personal experience: \u201cSuddenly I was 19 again and I began to remember all the men who had taken advantage of the fact that I was a young woman who didn\u2019t yet have the tools to say no, or understand the value of my own self-worth,\u201d said Johansson who appeared in her first film at the age of 10. \u201cI had many relationships both personal and professional where the power dynamic was so off that I had to create a narrative that I was the cool girl who could hang in and hang out, and that sometimes meant compromising what felt right for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo more pandering,\u201d Johansson concluded. \u201cNo more feeling guilty about hurting someone\u2019s feelings when something doesn\u2019t feel right for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have made a promise to myself to be responsible to my self, that in order to trust my instincts I must first respect them.\u201d",

As a result, Johnson spent a ton of time navigating her way through some of the series' most intensely intimate moments (three words: ice cream foreplay). Here, the actress talks to MarieClaire.com about which scene was the hardest to film, the least sexy thing about making this movie, doing shots with Jamie Dornan, and having a thong superglued onto her body. Yes, truly.\n\n(Image credit: Universal Pictures)\n\nYes, there's a specific sex scene shooting schedule:\n\n\"If we could do all of the sex scenes in a day or so, that would truly be in the Guinness Book of World Records. A lot of it was dependent on the locations, and because we shot the second and third film back to back, the sex scenes were kind of grouped in all together for the most part. And some were not in those two weeks.\"\n\nThat intense handcuffing scene in the Red Room (you know the one) was incredibly tough:\n\n\"The most difficult one by far\u2014I think in all three movies\u2014was a sex scene in the third film where I was handcuffed with my arms and legs to the gate. It's like a fence thing that comes down. And I was blindfolded. And it was kind of shocking, because I didn't realize that no matter how prepared or rehearsed I was, when your senses are taken away like that, you can't control the way your nervous system will react. So it was really tricky to navigate that scene. It was kind of difficult.\"\n\nThey do shots before sex scenes, which, understandable:\n\n\"Most of [our preparation] is just really figuring out exactly how were are going to accomplish the scene beforehand\u2014so that there's not a lot of waiting around while we're both vulnerable. But, if something is very, very difficult, it's sometimes necessary to have a shot of something strong beforehand.\u201d\n\nDoing those scenes never gets less awkward:\n\n\"No, it's never easy. It's not casual and it's not fun. It never got easy.\"\n\n(Image credit: Universal Pictures)\n\nUm, she had a thong superglued to her body:\n\n\"Oh yeah, Jamie's little pouch. It's super not glamorous\u2014it's really unsexy. He wore that, and I had these sort of strapless thongs that had glue on them. It's not glue, but it's sticky. They're, like, basically if it were a nipple pastie, but underwear. But it's only sticky at the top, it's not sticky the whole way. It would also come off because the adhesive would wear out, so then they would superglue it to my body so that it wouldn't fall off. And I would wear two of them. It's not painful, I mean, it's barely anything. But I guess you have some sense of being covered. It's f*cking bizarre.\"\n\nGuys, they worked with a \"sex advisor\" so never say this movie wasn't well-researched:\n\n\"Jamie mostly had an advisor that was on set for the first film, not so much for the second. Then we just had people who specialized in knowing how things work, like how to use certain tools and toys. There's a certain method. It's very intricate and the details are really important. The rules are also really important. We didn't want to go make a movie about something we didn't research to the bone.

The formerly blind singer, 17, made Simon Cowell\u2019s jaw drop just seconds into his take on The Jackson 5\u2019s \u201cWho\u2019s Lovin\u2019 You.\u201d After receiving a standing ovation from the judges and audience, Howie Mandel slammed the coveted button.\n\n\u201cI wanted to cry,\u201d Guardino tells EW, reliving the unexpected moment of glory. \u201cI was really nervous before I got on stage. I was just thinking, I can\u2019t mess up. I can\u2019t mess up. I can\u2019t mess up. But when I saw everything that was going on with the judges, all my nerves turned into strong energy and excitement. I started going off on the song and getting comfortable.\u201d\n\nMaking Guardino\u2019s AGT experience even more special: He was able to watch all the action go down. \u201cI would have never been able to see it before,\u201d says Guardino, who was totally blind before a revolutionary treatment helped him regain most of his sight when he was 12.\n\nStruggling with his vision impairment as a child, Guardino turned to melody. \u201cMusic was always my escape,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was dealing with my condition, it was a way to forget everything that was happening.\u201d\n\nHis disability would end up amplifying his musical talent, too. \u201cMy hearing was strengthened because of my eyesight,\u201d he says. \u201cI hear music in a strong way. It\u2019s always been there for me.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: Here\u2019s How To Save on Concert Tickets So You Still Have Money For Merch\n\nHaving grown up in a musical family, Guardino already has an impressive musical background: In middle school, he performed in a circuit of talent shows on Long Island and sang multiple times at the Apollo Theater. He also performed a duet with Jordin Sparks in November at an event for Michelle Obama\u2019s Partnership for a Healthy America in Washington D.C.\n\nNow he wants to take on songwriting, looking to his idol Stevie Wonder for inspiration. \u201cI feel like I relate to him and what he goes through being blind and struggling with his sight,\u201d he says. \u201cI love his voice. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\nHe also looks up to Cowell. While Mandel was the judge to press the golden buzzer for Guardino, immediately securing him a spot in the quarterfinals, Guardino says it was Cowell he was trying to impress. \u201cI know Simon\u2019s so honest and he\u2019s going to tell me how it was, and if I wasn\u2019t good he would tell me,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut I\u2019m really glad he liked me!\u201d\n\nCowell\u2019s October announcement that he would return to the show motivated Guardino to audition. \u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of America\u2019s Got Talent and ever since Simon came on it was like, No way. It felt like I had to do this,\u201d remembers Guardino, who went to the pre-round auditions after learning they were being held in New York City\u2019s Queens borough in January. \u201cIt\u2019s been my dream to go in front of him.\u201d\n\nAfter his successful Los Angeles audition, Guardino spotted Cowell outside the theater and walked up to him. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be really good friends,\u201d Guardino recalls hearing from Cowell, who hugged him and praised his vocal performance.\n\nThe compliments have poured in, with host Tyra Banks tweeting, \u201cYou just BLEW ME AWAY!\u201d on Tuesday, and Howie Mandel singing his praises in a YouTube video. As Mandel pointed out, the last person to receive a Golden Buzzer from him was last year\u2019s pre-teen contestant Grace VanderWaal, whom Guardino says he\u2019d like to ask for performance tips as he preps for his next appearance on the show in early August. Right now, though, he\u2019s not looking at it as a competition \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll get way too nervous if I think of it that way,\u201d he says \u2014 but rather just another great opportunity to perform.",

The artist claims that the incident took place at a beach in California following a photoshoot where the director asked her to pose naked.\n\n\u201cAt first I had the understanding I was just going to the beach with my mom. We were there for a little while by ourselves and then he was there,\u201d Barnard said. \u201cAnd she explained that this man wanted to take pictures of me in this fur coat. I thought it was to go into a magazine or something.\u201d\n\nBarnard says that Polanski initially took photos of her wearing a fur coat and a bikini but later asked her to pose naked. \u201cAt some point I realised my mom had gone. I don\u2019t know where she went and I didn\u2019t really register her leaving but she was no longer there. Then he molested me,\u201d she added.\n\nBarnard, who says she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and claustrophobia as a result of her experiences, felt emboldened to come forward following the scandal surrounding disgraced mogul Harvey Weinstein, who denies allegations of criminal sexual harassment, rape and sexual assault made against him by more than 50 women.\n\n\u201cI felt terribly conflicted that I have been silent all this time and all these women are bravely coming forward and I thought to myself I can\u2019t in good conscience knowing what I know \u2013 and having gone through what I\u2019ve gone through \u2013 not speak out,\u201d Barnard said. \u201cEven though it puts me in a very bad \u2026 position with my mom and Polanski and other people who are involved, I can\u2019t be silent any more.\u201d\n\nBarnard has made an official report with the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s Robbery-Homicide Division (RHD) sex crimes unit about the incident and has also launched a petition calling on the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to revoke Polanski\u2019s membership, as they have done with Weinstein.\n\nSpeaking via his agent, Polanski denied the claims. \u201cI entirely reject the unfounded allegations of Mme. Barnard, of whom I have no knowledge,\u201d the director said.\n\nPolanski remains a fugitive from justice after leaving the US shortly before he was due to stand trial for the sexual assault of a minor in 1977. The director had admitted to unlawful sexual intercourse with 13-year-old Samantha Geimer in pre-trial custody, but fled the country, fearing that a plea bargain he had made with prosecutors would be overruled. In June, a superior court judge rejected a request to dismiss the case by Geimer, who says she has forgiven Polanski and wants the incident put to rest \u201cas an act of mercy to myself and my family\u201d.\n\nSince Geimer\u2019s allegations, the director has faced allegations of sexual assault by three additional women. In 2010, British actor Charlotte Lewis said that Polanski had \u201cforced himself\u201d on her while she was auditioning for a role in Paris in 1983, while this year, two more women have come forward with their own accounts of alleged assault at the hands of the director.",

THE ROYAL UK can reveal the truth. We\u2019re told it\u2019s \u201cnot true.\u201d\n\nThe unsubstantiated allegation can be found in the latest issue of OK! The misleading headline reads as, \u201cMeghan and Harry: Royal Rule Breakers\u201d. In the following story, the tabloid suspiciously contends that Queen Elizabeth was unhappy with Markle\u2019s casual outfit. They also claimed that the Queen didn\u2019t like the affectionate and PDA-filled attitude towards Prince Harry.\n\nAlso Read: Prince Harry\u2019s girlfriend Meghan Markle finally meets Queen Elizabeth.\n\nA so-called \u201cpalace insider\u201d is quoted as saying, \u201cThe Queen thought Meghan\u2019s loose, men\u2019s-style shirt, ripped jeans and oversized bag were not a suitable choice for her first public engagement with the prince.\u201d After seeing photographs of the couple at the Invictus Games, OK! magazine goes on to claim that the Queen has requested Prince Harry and Markle not to hold hands in public.\n\nThere have been some reports that the Queen asked both of them to attend coaching sessions on \u201croyal protocol and etiquette.\u201d \u201cMeghan needs to step up her game to join the royal family. Luckily, the Queen is prepared to do whatever necessary to help,\u201d concludes the outlet\u2019s alleged \u201cinsider.\u201d\n\nBut THE ROYAL UK investigated into the whole matter, and not surprisingly, a royal source tells us the report is \u201ccompletely fake.\u201d Queen Elizabeth was not upset with the actress over her first public outing with Prince Harry, nor was she disappointed with Markle\u2019s outfit and attitude at the annual sporting event. Additionally, a \u201creal\u201d palace insider wouldn\u2019t be discussing such details with OK! magazine. The article is nothing more than a fabrication.\n\nNotably, this isn\u2019t the first time OK! has tried to dupe its readers into thinking it has reputable sources for the royal family. In September, THE ROYAL UK corrected the outlet for inaccurately announcing a \u201cwedding of the century\u201d for Markle and Prince Harry on its cover. In that story, a purported \u201cpalace planner\u201d claimed to have the scoop on the couple\u2019s \u201cbig day,\u201d but as we noted at the time, a genuine royal source wouldn\u2019t have fed an American tabloid with information about a royal wedding before an engagement was even announced. Similarly to that bogus report, this latest one is equally manufactured.\n\nRelated\n\nComments\n\ncomments",

On the issue of Church religious practices, we do not know who your anonymous sources are, but they got it all wrong. The answer to your question is no. Scientologists respect the faith of others, associate with and befriend members of every religion. Scientologists do not cut ties with non-Scientologist friends or family members because they have chosen another religion. Given that Scientology is a new religion, Scientologists often have family members and friends who are not Scientologists and who may practice another faith or no faith at all. This causes no conflict for Scientologists.\u201d\n\nCruise\u2019s rep had no comment.",

        "content": "Michelle Obama and Barack Obama might be two of the most-missed former residents of the White House. Even though Obama's presidency ended over a year-and-a-half ago, the couple known for being #relationshipgoals has recently come back into the spotlight. With Obama's 57th birthday on Saturday, Aug. 4, Michelle took to social media to wish her husband a happy birthday with a sweet post about him. Michelle Obama wished Barack Obama happy birthday with a thoughtful photo and message to Obama on Instagram.\n\nLike any good significant other in the age of technology, Michelle made sure that she wished Obama a happy birthday on social media. The photo of Obama on Instagram and Twitter is accompanied by a short caption, but Michelle did anything but phone it in on this one. She posted what looks like a personal picture of Obama looking deep in thought as he overlooks a desert, and she wrote,\n\nHappy birthday @BarackObama! The view is always better with you.\n\nOK, you can now add \"expert at writing captions\" to Michelle's resume. I mean, c'mon, that post is sure to bring a smile to Obama's face when he sees it. Would you really expect anything less from this couple, though?\n\nThese two have proven time and again that they know how to keep their relationship going strong. Just look at their date night on the weekend of July 28, when the couple attended Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z's OTR II tour in Maryland. Not only did they make time to spend together at the show, but they spent that time doing what you should be doing at a Beyonc\u00e9 concert: dancing! Seriously, the Obamas showed that they know how to move to the music, and the lucky concertgoers around them caught it all on video \u2014 but beware to get all the FOMO when you watch it.\n\nWhen it comes to birthdays, though, it really isn't shocking that Michelle knocked it out of the park with this post. Her short and sweet caption about how \"the view is always better\" with Obama is such a thoughtful message to her husband. The swoon-worthy birthday posts must be a hallmark of their relationship, because Obama also shared an IG post to his better half on Jan. 17 to celebrate Michelle's big day. He wrote,\n\nYou're not only my wife and the mother of my children, you're my best friend. I love your strength, your grace, and your determination. And I love you more each day. Happy Birthday, @MichelleObama\n\nIt's not only birthdays that bring out the sweet messages from this couple, though. Obama also wrote Michelle a Valentine's Day post on Feb. 14 that said she makes \"every day and every place better.\" I'm inclined to agree with the former POTUS on that one.\n\nReally, there is no shortage of examples of how these two celebrate and lift each other up on the most special days in their lives. I would like to imagine that they are also they kind of couple that leaves little love notes for each other around the house on a daily basis.\n\nOf course, I don't know if that's how the Obamas roll, but I do know they've perfected the art of the social media birthday post. Hopefully Obama is brainstorming Michelle's post for January!",

Located in New York City, the school is famous for its performing arts program, which has clearly benefited Violetta and her beau.\n\nAnsel and Violetta's romance began when Violetta, unaware that Ansel went to the same school as her, spotted the budding actor and immediately noticed his good looks.\n\nMemories: Violetta Komyshan has revealed how she and her boyfriend Ansel Elgort met back in high school, when both of them were attending Fiorello H. LaGuardia School\n\nPast: The ballerina, 21, met the Baby Driver star, who is now 23, back when both of them were students at the New York City school, which is famous for its performing arts program\n\n'I think he had his eye on me, because we were in the same lunch period or something,' she told Cosmopolitan in a new interview.\n\n'[One day freshman year] I was with my friend, and he was walking down the block. I didn't even know he went to my school\u2014I just thought he was really attractive.'\n\nLuckily, a friend of Violetta's was there to tell her more about the mysterious stranger.\n\n'I looked at him and told my friend, \"Oh my God, that guy's so hot,\" and she's like, \"Oh that's Ansel, he goes to LaGuardia,\"' Violetta added.\n\n'Then he walked up to us and said, \"What's good?\" and [mimes a fist bump]. I thought he liked her!'\n\nAlthough she was originally convinced Ansel was on his way to developing a crush on her friend, the actor's behavior made it clear he was in fact interested in getting to know Violetta better.\n\n'He waited for me [after school] the next day and told our friend to introduce us and I was like, \"OK, he totally liked me yesterday,\"' the ballerina said.\n\n'Then I made her come with us to Starbucks. We exchanged numbers and became friends, and then we started dating when I was at the end of sophomore year.'\n\nOrigin story: Ansel and Violetta's romance began when Violetta (pictured with Ansel last month in Sydney, Australia), spotted the budding actor and noticed his good looks\n\nDuo: Violetta (pictured in an Instagram snap taken behind the scenes while Ansel was shooting Baby Driver) first thought the actor had a crush on her friend\n\nIt worked out: But Ansel waited for her after school the next day, and Violetta realized he was, in fact, interested in getting to know her better\n\nBeing the girlfriend of a high-profile actor means Violetta sometimes has to deal with abusive comments from some of his fans, especially on social media. The dancer has an impressive 838,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nVioletta, who said she occasionally gets comments such as 'You're ugly', doesn't pay them much attention.\n\n'There's no substance to those little comments they make,' she said. 'Sometimes they'll insult what I'm wearing or something, but who cares? It's fashion, whatever. I just stay away from that.'\n\nNowadays, Violetta says she get much more positive feedback than negative remarks, with plenty of social media users gushing over how cute the couple is.\n\nThe social media star also revealed that Ansel, the son of the American fashion photographer Arthur Elgort, is behind a lot of the pictures that have appeared on her feed.\n\n'He takes a lot of my photos,' she said. 'He really knows when I look genuinely happy and beautiful. His dad's a photographer, and [Ansel] really learned how to use a camera growing up. He knows my light, he knows everything. He could just be my personal photographer and he'd be great at it because he's so good.'\n\nSnaps: Violetta and Ansel regularly share pictures of themselves together on social media, and sometimes write cute messages for their significant other on their own platforms\n\nBacklash: Being the girlfriend of a high-profile actor means Violetta sometimes has to deal with abusive comments from some of his fans, especially on social media\n\nHandling it: But nowadays, Violetta (pictured with Ansel at a basketball game last year in New York City) says she get much more positive feedback than negative remarks\n\nVioletta and Ansel regularly share pictures of themselves together on social media, and sometimes write cute messages for their significant other on their own platforms.\n\nLast month, Ansel posted a couple of photos of his girlfriend, pointing out in the caption that he's been 'obsessed with her since high school'. The post remains one of Violetta's favorites.\n\n'I was like, \"Awww.\" Which is true, we've been together like six years!' she added.\n\nThe dancer and social media sensation also admitted to editing her photos before she posts them, and revealed she loves the app VSCO for that purpose.\n\n'Sometimes if I have too many pimples or something\u2014we all have problems with our skin sometimes\u2014I'll edit that out, but only if it's really visible,' she said.\n\n'I love pretty photos, that's it\u2014so if a filter makes it prettier, I'll do it. I'll brighten it a little just to make it pop more\u2014make the sky more blue or make the grass more green.'",

A bike patrol officer verified Jesse's ID and left after confirming that Jesse was OK, ET reports. It's not known why the officer conducted the check.\n\nIn May, Fontana Police booked and released the former MTV VJ for alleged possession of methamphetamine, but there was no additional information available.\n\nJesse won MTV's first \"Wanna Be a VJ\" in 1998. He became famous for his shaggy hair and irreverence. Later, he had a stint as a rocker with a 1998 album called \"Jesse & the 8th Street Kidz.\" He has mostly been out of the spotlight in recent years, but appeared on a Funny Or Die program called \"Triumph's Election Special\" in 2016.",

        "content": "The media campaign surrounding Bruce Jenner\u2019s public transformation into Caitlyn Jenner has been nothing short of masterful, from the substance of Diane Sawyer\u2019s two-hour \u201c20/20\u201d interview special in April to the sizzle of this week\u2019s Vanity Fair cover reveal of Caitlyn in a bustier.\n\nThe person guiding the strategy behind the scenes has been Alan Nierob, a seasoned showbiz publicist and longtime exec at Rogers & Cowan. Last fall Jenner hired Nierob, who has handled crisis PR for some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest names including Robert Downey Jr. and Mel Gibson, for help in guiding her through a storm of media attention as she came out as transgender. Nierob declined to comment on this story.\n\nSources close to the situation said Jenner turned to Nierob for a very specific reason \u2014 one that is poignant in light of the turns in Jenner\u2019s life today. In the mid-1980s, Nierob helped Jenner at a moment of crisis when a reporter for the New York Times was pursuing a story about Jenner being a cross-dresser.\n\nAt the time, Jenner was on the rebound from a career downturn and was enjoying a new round of endorsement deals and media gigs. In the mid-1980s, a story about the Olympic decathlon star dressing in women\u2019s clothing would have severely damaged, if not destroyed, Jenner\u2019s public image.\n\nJenner had previously been repped by Rogers & Cowan around the time of his 1976 Olympic triumph but never by Nierob. The two knew each other through mutual associates. In the early 1980s Jenner worked for ABC and NBC covering auto racing at a time when Nierob represented star driver Danny Sullivan.\n\nWhen Jenner was approached by the Times with questions about cross-dressing, Jenner confided in Nierob about her gender dysphoria condition. Nierob was never formally hired as Jenner\u2019s rep \u2014 he helped her out as a friend. Nierob worked briefly but intensely with Jenner\u2019s then-manager and attorney to dissuade the Times reporter from pursuing the story. He used all the PR pressure tricks: strenuous denials, questioning the motives of his sources and emphasizing the ramifications of such a story for Jenner and his family. No story ever ran.\n\nThirty-odd years later, Jenner turned to Nierob for help on the journey to becoming Caitlyn because of the level of trust between them. Jenner felt Nierob never betrayed the confidence and never gossiped in Hollywood circles about the incident.\n\nWork on the campaign to explain Jenner\u2019s transformation began late last fall when Nierob reached out to Diane Sawyer for what he knew would be a landmark TV moment for public awareness of the transgender community. He knew it had to be serious and substantive to dispel any suggestion that the emergence of Caitlyn was a publicity stunt.\n\nSawyer\u2019s work on the Jenner interview began at an emotional time for the ABC News anchor, following the November death of her husband, director Mike Nichols.\n\nAfter the April 24 \u201c20/20\u201d interview generated rave reviews and 17 million viewers, the first promotion for Jenner\u2019s upcoming E! docu-series, which was officially announced during Sawyer\u2019s interview, began to hit.\n\nThe June 1 release of the Vanity Fair cover, which revealed Jenner\u2019s new name and look, coincided with the launch of her @Caitlyn_Jenner twitter account. Jenner racked up more than 1 million followers in a few hours, a new Twitter record, and had more than 2 million as of Friday.\n\nOn Tuesday ESPN announced that Jenner would receive the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the July 15 ESPY Awards. That will be followed by the July 26 premiere of E!\u2019s \u201cI Am Cait,\u201d which runs eight episodes. The series will chronicle Jenner\u2019s transformation over the past few months and also show her on a new mission to be an advocate for public understanding and tolerance of transgender community concerns.\n\nIn fact, sources said Jenner has been on the road this week shooting material for \u201cI Am Cait\u201d and hasn\u2019t had much time to catch up with the latest round of coverage.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s doing it,\u201d a source close to Jenner says. \u201cShe\u2019s not sitting at home reading her own press. She\u2019s on a mission to save lives and make a difference.\u201d",

But she still makes less than the world\u2019s 14 richest actors.\n\nLooking at Forbes\u2019 highest-paid actors list, Stone is 14 places below other male stars in terms of total earnings, including her La La Land co-star Ryan Gosling. Mark Wahlberg took the top spot after earning $68 million over the last year for his roles in Transformers: The Last Knight (which has a 15% score on Rotten Tomatoes), Deepwater Horizon, and Patriots Day.

Reports also claimed that the lip kit businesswoman was annoyed with the supposed fact that Tyga would spend more time at the club with his friends than with her at their home in Calabasas.\n\nAs of right now, it doesn\u2019t seem as if Kylie Jenner has any plans to get back with the \u201cRack City\u201d rapper in the near future, which has led Kris to throw in her two cents, allegedly telling her daughter that she should consider the idea of dating Drake.\n\nThe \u201cOne Dance\u201d hitmaker has become a very close friend to the Kardashians over the last couple of years, having even attended Kylie\u2019s 17th birthday party two years ago. The family famously invited Drake over for dinner a year ago, having also attended their Christmas party in 2015.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that Drake is no stranger to Kylie Jenner or her famous family.\n\nSo, it wouldn\u2019t be much of a stretch to consider the potential chances of Kylie and Drake hooking up \u2014 at least according to Hollywood Life.\n\nThe outlet suggests that Drake and Kylie would make a perfect couple, especially with Kris Jenner under their wings, who is already said to be working her magic to make it happen. The momager reportedly believes that dating Drake is a complete upgrade from Tyga: Drizzy and Kylie Jenner are super successful and share a lot of things in common, so it\u2019s a match made in heaven, it would seem.\n\n\u201cKris wants to see Kylie move on from Tyga, she thinks the drama and the constant back and forth is a waste of time,\u201d an insider tells Hollywood Life. \u201cShe wants to see her happy and get out there and start dating.\u201d\n\n\u201cKris thinks Kylie should give Drake a chance, she wants them to date. Kylie Jenner and Drake are friends, she\u2019s cool with him but she\u2019s still very wrapped up in Tyga. While Kim and Kris are in Kylie\u2019s ear telling her to dump him, Khloe and Kourtney are telling her to make it work.\u201d\n\nAs the source already mentions, while Kylie Jenner has more or less accepted the fact that she won\u2019t be getting back with Tyga, she\u2019s still hanging on the two-year relationship she shared with her 27-year-old ex-boyfriend, with a source adding that it\u2019s not that easy for her to move on.\n\nLast year, it was even claimed, via Heat World, that Kylie Jenner had confided in her family, telling them that she was convinced she would end up marrying the \u201cFaded\u201d rapper in the near future, adding that she couldn\u2019t see herself with anybody else but him.\n\nNow that allegations regarding baby mama drama and cheating affairs have come forward, Kylie Jenner has definitely had a change of heart. She doesn\u2019t want to surround herself with people that could potentially waste her energy on something that she shouldn\u2019t be focused on in the first place.\n\nWith business booming, Kylie Jenner\u2019s main concern is continuing to market her brand, and while she still cares for Tyga, it seems evidently clear that their romance has officially come to an end.\n\nWhat do you think? Will Kylie Jenner end up dating Drake in the near future?\n\n[Featured Image by Jason Kempin/Getty Images]",

Following an eruption of violence in the college town where one person was killed and 19 people were injured after a car hit protesters leaving a rally.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, President Trump condemned the violence but blamed \u201cmany sides.\u201d\n\nThe White House issued a statement Sunday saying \"The President said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred. Of course that includes white supremacists, KKK Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups.\" But the president has not used those words himself.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats criticized the president for not being more forceful in calling out white nationalists groups.\n\nTrump \u201cmissed an opportunity to be very explicit here,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said on Fox News Sunday.\n\nThe white nationalists \u201cseem to believe they have a friend in Donald Trump in the White House\u2026 I would urge the president to dissuade them of the [idea] that he is sympathetic to their cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need more from our president on this issue \u2026 it\u2019s up to him to correct the record here,\" Graham said.\n\nSen.

And what he did is he called on all Americans to take a firm stance against it,\" said Trump National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. \"The president called out anyone who is responsible for fomenting this kind of bigotry, hatred, racism and violence.

Moore even tried on the original dress, just to get the perfect fit.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very symbolic of her rebirth,\u201d Cloud said about the whole design process. \u201cIt was such a cool look then, we thought, \u2018Why not revisit it now?\u2019 It\u2019s a beautiful, elegant silhouette.

She turned to very hip LA sisters and beauty gurus Ashley Streicher and Jenn Streicher for her hair and makeup yesterday.\n\nMandy's nude pout involved a layer of Laura Mercier Lip Pencil in Chestnut, with Laura Mercier Velour Extreme Matte Lipstick in Vibe applied on top. Her smoky copper eye involved a wash of Laura Mercier Caviar Stick Eye Colour in Copper up to the crease of her eyelid, with Laura Mercier Caviar Stick Eye Colour in Peacock as a pop of blue color in the corner of her eyes. On her nails, she wore Essie's Mademoiselle nail polish.\n\nTo get those bouncy curls, Ashley wrapped Moore's blow-dried hair in 1.25-inch velcro rollers and sprayed it with Garnier Fructis Style Full Control Anti-Humidity Aerosol Hairspray. After 20 minutes, Ashley took out the rollers, brushed out the curls with a boar bristle brush and hit it again with the hairspray. She brushed back one side and pinned it behind Moore's ear, then finished the look with Garnier Fructis Style Texture Tease Dry Touch Finishing Spray.\n\nSo classic Hollywood!

Although Affleck denied any wrongdoing, he ultimately settled both lawsuits.\n\nThe allegations of the harassment resurfaced during Affleck\u2019s Best Actor campaign for Manchester by the Sea; following his Oscars win, actress Brie Larson and others refused to clap for Affleck.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, that I was ever involved in a conflict that resulted in a lawsuit is something that I really regret. I wish I had found a way to resolve things in a different way. I hate that. I had never had any complaints like that made about me before in my life and it was really embarrassing and I didn\u2019t know how to handle it and I didn\u2019t agree with everything, the way I was being described, and the things that were said about me, but I wanted to try to make it right, so we made it right in the way that was asked at the time. And we all agreed to just try to put it behind us and move on with our lives, which I think we deserve to do, and I want to respect them as they\u2019ve respected me and my privacy. And that\u2019s that,\u201d Affleck told the AP.\n\n\u201cOver the past couple of years, I\u2019ve been listening a lot to this conversation, this public conversation, and learned a lot. I kind of moved from a place of being defensive to one of a more mature point of view, trying to find my own culpability. And once I did that I discovered there was a lot to learn. I was a boss. I was one of the producers on the set. This movie was [shot in 2008, 2009] and I was one of the producers. And it was a crazy mockumentary, [a] very unconventional movie. The cast was the crew and the crew was kind of the cast and it was an unprofessional environment and, you know, the buck had to stop with me being one of the producers and I have to accept responsibility for that and that was a mistake.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nWith Affleck back as director on his upcoming film Light of My Life, he also talked about how the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up campaigns have impacted Hollywood.\n\n\u201cI think bigger picture, in this business women have been underrepresented and underpaid and objectified and diminished and humiliated and belittled in a bazillion ways and just generally had a mountain of grief thrown at them forever. And no one was really making too much of a fuss about it, myself included, until a few women with the kind of courage and wisdom to stand up and say, \u2018You know what? Enough is enough,'\u201d Affleck said.\n\n\u201cThose are the people who are kind of leading this conversation and should be leading the conversation. And I know just enough to know that in general I need to keep my mouth shut and listen and try to figure out what\u2019s going on and be a supporter and a follower in the little, teeny tiny ways that I can.\u201d\n\nAffleck next appears in The Old Man & The Gun, which also marks Robert Redford\u2019s final acting role.",

Take the mask out of the packet, unfold it and place it over your face, positioning it so you can see through the holes for your eyes. You can apply it directly to cleansed skin or you can apply a moisturising serum first to boost hydration.

While finding out that Spencer has an evil twin named Alex Drake was a major bombshell, that wasn't the only loose end the series needed to tie up. And as satisfying as that reveal may have been, there are still questions Pretty Little Liars never answered.\n\nConsidering just how many characters visited Rosewood during the series' 160 episodes, it makes sense that not everyone got a proper goodbye or even an adequate backstory. But it's still pretty confusing that some people (hello, remember Aria's brother?) seemingly fell off the face of the earth and never were heard from again.\n\nBelow are a series of questions that Pretty Little Liars didn't answer over the course of the show. By no means is this a comprehensive list, since there are probably a dozen other aspects that left you scratching your head. But hey, it's a solid place to start. And if showrunner I. Marlene King wants to offer up any answers, PLL fans will obviously welcome any explanations with open arms.\n\n1. Why Didn't Mike Attend Aria & Ezra's Wedding?\n\nFreeform\n\nSeriously, her little bro was nowhere in sight.\n\n2. Actually, What Happened To Mike In General?\n\nIs he OK? He totally vanished.\n\n3. Did Mona & Mike Keep In Touch?\n\nAt one time, the two were deeply in love.\n\n4. Speaking Of Brothers, Why Didn't Wesley Attend The Wedding?\n\nRemember Wesley Fitz? Ezra's little brother?\n\n5. How Did The Moms Ever Get Out Of The Basement?\n\nFreeform\n\nThe moms acknowledge the mystery in the finale, when Veronica goes, \"Oh my god, remember how we got out of there?\" \u2014 without actually saying how.\n\n6. And Why Was It So Bad That Pam Fields Didn't Drink For A Year Afterwards?\n\nWhat. Happened. In. The. Basement.\n\n7. Who Makes All The Masks In Rosewood?\n\nThey're insanely realistic.\n\n8. How Do They Make All Those Masks?\n\nFreeform\n\nNo, really, how?\n\n9. And Does The Mask Maker Know What They're Are Used For?\n\nFreeform\n\nAs in, tormenting people and being way too deceiving.\n\n10. Speaking Of Masks, Who Was In That Creepy Halloween Mask?\n\nNo explanation was ever given. It wasn't Noel.\n\n11. Who Was Beach Hottie?\n\nI. Marlene King once told Bustle even she didn't know.\n\n12. What Did Sydney Get Out Of This Whole Situation?\n\nLike, why was she helping Jenna in the first place?\n\n13. And Why Did She Look So Much Like Jenna?\n\nIt really seemed like they were gonna secretly be sisters.\n\n14. What Was Bethany Young's Deal?\n\nShe was buried in Ali's grave, and killed Toby's mom while in Radley. But how she fits into the whole story is still unclear.\n\n15. And Why Did Bethany Draw These Pictures?\n\nOr at least, she drew the bottom ones. But that top one from the game looks a lot like her handy work.\n\n16. Who Was That Blonde Girl In Jason's Window?\n\nWay back in Season 1, Spencer spots someone in Jason's window. She looked a lot like Ali, but no explanation was given.\n\n17. What Exactly Did Maya Know?\n\nIn this scene, Mona speaks in an acronym: \"Miss Aria, You're A Killer, Not Ezra's Wife.\" It spells out \"MAYA KNEW,\" but no one knows what she knew.\n\n18. Why Does Mona Love Paris So Much?\n\nFreeform\n\nShe moves there at the very end of the finale, but she also decorated her high school bedroom with tributes to the city of love. Why?\n\n19. Who Built The Elaborate Doll House Mona Keeps A.D. & Mary In?\n\nFreeform\n\nSure, she's a genius, but that's not the same as being an architect.\n\n20. Why Did Sara Harvey & Bethany Young Look So Much Alike?\n\nThere were theories they were the same person, yet none came to fruition.\n\n21. Why Did Charlotte Kidnap Sara In The First Place?\n\nThey're connection remains fuzzy.\n\n22. Why Did Rhys From The Carissimi Group Look Just Like Jason?\n\nThis seemed to hint at another twin connection.\n\n23. Did A Kill Mrs. Potter?\n\nIt was implied when they brought flowers to her grave, but would A really kill someone just to save Hanna's mom?\n\n24. Was Lucas Actually Evil?\n\nHis intentions were never really fleshed out. Was he really sincerely helping Hanna?\n\n25. Why Did Eddie Lamb Recognize Aria?\n\nThat Radley scene will forever be suspicious.\n\n26. What Happened To Melissa In The End?\n\nYeah, Mona was wearing a mask with her face, but her storyline never got wrapped up.\n\n27. Why Was Melissa's Helmet At Bethany's Stable?\n\nIt's unclear how much Melissa really knew.\n\n28. Was That Spencer/Maddie Ziegler Scene A Twin Reference?\n\nIt sure was something. (And by something, I really mean \"creepy.\")\n\n29. Did Peter Know About Spencer's Twin?\n\nIt could explain his connection to Radley, or he could've been totally in the dark.\n\n30. Who Was Wren Drawing Back In Radley?\n\nIt's unlikely he'd already met Alex a this point. Was it supposed to be Ali in her red coat as Vivian Darkbloom? And if so, who are those other little kids?\n\n31. Why Was Ezra So Into Chickpeas?\n\nYes, it was an excuse to get Aria to go to the store, but what a random food choice.\n\n32. Is Nicole OK?\n\nHer storyline kind of fell to the wayside.\n\n33. Did Nicole Mind That Ezra's Book About Her Was Being Made Into A Movie?\n\nSince you know, it involves her personal business.\n\n34. Why Is Mona So Fascinated By Dolls?\n\nFreeform\n\nNot only does she have quite the collection, but she now owns a doll shop.\n\n35. Was Mona The One Who Sent Ali That Voodoo Doll In Season 1?\n\nOr was this a hint from Charlotte way back when?\n\n36. What Ever Happened To Tippi The Bird?\n\nWas this Charlotte's pet? It's never been explained.\n\n37. What Did Noel Have Against The Liars Anyway?\n\nThere's no explanation for what he gained out of this. And he wound up beheaded.\n\n38. How Is This Scene Possible?\n\nHat tip to this Twitter user, because it makes zero sense.\n\n39. How Exactly Did A.D. Make The Game?\n\nThat is some elaborate technology, but the girl couldn't even do a convincing British accent.\n\nWhile the PLL finale set up the show for a spinoff, it's still unlikely that all of these lingering questions will ever get answered. The only solution? Let the theorizing continue.",

Is one of this foursome your favorite ever coach? Or do you prefer one of the other eight singers who have left the panel? Vote in our poll below and sound off in the comments section.\n\nHudson was first a coach last fall on season 13 of this Emmy-winning show. She proved to be unlucky in her debut, just missing out on a place in the final when Noah Mac was the last of the Top 8 to be eliminated. That season marked the sixth win for Shelton. One of his artists, Chloe Kohanksi, won the title while another, Red Marlowe, made it to fourth place. Levine was denied his fourth win after Addison Agen had to settle for runner-up status. The fourth coach in season 13 was Miley Cyrus, who had started out with both Kohanski and Agen on her team.\n\nClarkson, who was an advisor on Season 13, was a coach for the first time this spring. The first winner of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d used her experience on that reality competition series to mentor Brynn Cartelli to the win. She has strong opinions and held her own then against both Shelton and Levine. She connected with the other woman on the panel, Alicia Keys, who was back in the chair for a third stint, coming off a win in spring 2017.\n\nSEE \u2018The Voice\u2019 Winners Full List: Photos and Where Are They Now Updates\n\nIs one of these your favorite coach of all-time?

In her accompanying interview with the magazine, she opens up about her first marriage with Ryan Sweeting -- and what led to their divorce.\n\nCuoco, 32, and Sweeting, 30, became engaged in September 2013 after three months of dating, and tied the knot on Dec. 31, 2013, in Santa Susana, California. They announced they were going their separate ways in September 2015, and according to Cuoco, it was all Sweeting's doing.\n\n\"I honestly thought I wouldn\u2019t get married again,\" Kuoco, who's currently planning her wedding with fianc\u00e9 Karl Cook, recalls. \"My ex ruined that word for me.\"\n\n\"I married someone the first time who completely changed,\" she continues. \"The person I ended up with was not the person I originally met. And that wasn\u2019t my fault -- that was his. I knew how much I had to give and how much I wanted to receive. I knew I just had to be patient\u2026I had to go through a lot of things, but it brought me to Karl.\"\n\nJason Kim/Cosmopolitan\n\nClearly, Cuoco has moved past heartbreak and found love again with Cook, who she started dating in late 2016. While she seems to be head-over-heels for the equestrian, she's also focusing on running her own production company, Yes, Norman Productions.\n\n\"I want to be a full-on girl boss,\" she exclaims. \"I've been in the business so long, and I've worked with the best. I don't let people mess with me. I want to show girls out there that you can be cool, wear yoga clothes, and run your own f**king company. You don't have to be a guy in a suit.\"\n\n\"I want this to be a big company,\" she adds. \"I want to be sitting down a few years from now and have so many projects going. That's what I'm excited about.\"\n\nJason Kim/Cosmopolitan\n\nBut right now, wedding planning comes first! Cuoco announced last November that Cook had popped the question, and the two celebrated with a trip to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, a few weeks later. \"He took me to Disneyland and it was pure magic,\" Cuoco shared on Instagram at the time. \"Mad love for this group that surrounds me!\"\n\nET caught up with Cuoco at the Stand Up for Pits Benefit in Hollywood, California, just a few weeks before Cook got down on one knee. Cuoco seemed smitten by her beau, telling us he was \"totally the guy\" for her.\n\n\"I think the common denominator is the horses, it just works for us,\" she said of her and Cook's shared passion for equestrian and animals. \"We have this special bond so, yeah, the animals. He's so real. I've never met a kinder human being, he's gentle, and he's real. I'm completely in love with him. Nothing could be better.\"\n\nHear more from the exclusive interview in the video below!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:",

But there\u2019s a difference between being friendly and being inseparable.\n\n\u201cI think they are certainly friendly and they are spending more time with each other.

Two Virginia state troopers who were monitoring the protests were also killed in a helicopter crash.\n\nIn a joint statement issued Monday via the SPLC, the couple said they were \u201cproud\u201d to support the organization \u201cin its efforts to prevent violent extremism in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Charlottesville, and what is happening in communities across our country, demands our collective engagement to stand up to hate,\u201d they said.\n\nIn the aftermath of the event, President Donald Trump was criticized for his unwillingness to condemn white supremacists and Neo-Nazis in a press conference given days after the unrest.\n\n\u201cI think there is blame on both sides,\u201d Trump said during a news conference August 15.\n\nGeorge Clooney appeared to reference the President\u2019s comment in an additional statement, provided to CNN by a representative.\n\n\u201cAmal and I wanted to add our voice (and financial assistance) to the ongoing fight for equality. There are no two sides to bigotry and hate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Clooney Foundation for Justice was formed in 2016 to \u201cadvance justice in courtrooms, classrooms and communities around the world,\u201d according to a mission statement on its website.\n\nGeorge and Amal Clooney, who recently welcomed twins, serve as the foundation\u2019s presidents.\n\n\u201cLike George and Amal Clooney, we were shocked by the size, ugliness, and ferocity of the white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville,\u201d said SPLC President Richard Cohen in a statement. \u201cIt was a reflection of just how much Trump\u2019s incendiary campaign and presidency has energized the radical right. We are deeply grateful to the Clooney Foundation for standing with us at this critical moment in our country\u2019s fight against hate.\u201d\n\nThe SPLC said it tracks more than 1,600 extremist groups operating in the U.S.\n\nFurther details about the joint initiative are expected to be announced at a later date, the organization said.",

With the release of Taylor Swift\u2019s new single, \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d which blatantly disses Kanye West (and wife Kim Kardashian), the bad blood is at an all time high \u2014 at least, on the pop star\u2019s end. But rewind back to 2009, and you\u2019d get a very different story.\n\nWell, at least for Taylor and Kim. That was, of course, the year the drama between the Reputation songstress and Kanye started, when he interrupted her accepting the award for Video of the Year at the MTV VMAs.\n\nEventually, the two made up, but the feud was revived in 2016 when they fought over the rapper rapping \u201cI made that bitch famous\u201d in his song \u201cFamous.\u201d\n\nOf course, things only got worse after that, as Kim released a video of the phone call Taylor and Kanye had where she gave him permission to use that line.\n\nSo really, up until last year, there were no hard feelings between the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and singer \u2014 and now there\u2019s video proof!\n\nIn a resurfaced interview from 2009, the now-36-year-old reality star gushes about Taylor, calling herself a big fan of her work.\n\n\u201cI love Taylor Swift, I\u2019m the biggest Taylor Swift fan,\u201d the mother of two tells a reporter on the red carpet.\n\nShe goes on to add that her \u201cnumber one song\u201d on her iPod \u2014 throwback alert! \u2014 is Tay\u2019s 2008 single, \u201cLove Story.\u201d\n\nBlast from the past! Back in 2009, Kim Kardashian proclaims she was Taylor Swift's \"biggest fan.\" pic.twitter.com/RyBgeiyWqj EntertainmentTonight (@etnow) August 30, 2017\n\nCue another dated reference: \u201cI\u2019m watching her on Twitter, I just signed up on Twitter. I\u2019m watching you, Taylor, following.\u201d\n\nOh how time flies, right? It should be noted that at the time, Kim wasn\u2019t even dating her now-husband yet. In fact, she wasn\u2019t even dating Kris Humphries \u2014 they didn\u2019t meet for another year after that!\n\nCredit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nInterestingly, we hear Taylor\u2019s new music hasn\u2019t had the impact on the Wests she hoped it would have. Sources have said the couple \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d about her attacks, are focusing on their family, and even note that she\u2019s not \u201con their radar.\u201d\n\nStill, she\u2019s on Kim\u2019s radar when it comes to social media following, as the blonde recently surpassed the Instagram heavyweight in followers.\n\nThe two are neck-and-neck at 102.9 million IG fans, and with Taylor pulling ahead slightly, Kim seemingly retaliated with a risque post on Thursday.\n\nIn an apparent bid to gain more followers, she posted a sexy shot of her sunbathing in a nude string bikini.\n\nIt's really hot today A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Aug 30, 2017 at 4:48pm PDT",

But here you are, and you need to know how to clean these things properly.\n\nGetting rid of poop isn\u2019t fun, but it\u2019s not hard, either. (Unless the poop isn\u2019t hard \u2026 then it\u2019s hard. Breastfed-baby poop, anyone?)\n\nStart with the basics\n\nRemoving poop usually involves a two-step process. Here\u2019s what to do:\n\nCleaning.\n\nSanitizing or disinfecting.\n\nCleaning comes first because it\u2019s hard to disinfect something that hasn\u2019t been cleaned properly. This means getting rid of the bulk of the poop \u2014 whatever you can scrape off or otherwise remove \u2014 and washing the item or surface so that you can begin disinfecting (killing the germs).\n\nBut, should you wash the item with warm water or cold water? Depends. If it\u2019s a fabric that could potentially be stained, initially wash with cold water to avoid setting the stain. Warm water can be used if you\u2019re not worried about a permanent stain.\n\nTo quickly clean your basic fabric items (like a stained onesie that has those tell-tale yellow leaks streaking from the seams of the diaper area) follow these steps:\n\nRemove as much of the poop as you can (and work as quickly as possible; cleaning immediately can minimize the potential for staining).\n\nRinse or soak with cold water (blotting helps).\n\nWash in the washing machine using hot water, an enzyme-based cleaner (if suitable for the fabric) and bleach or vinegar (if suitable for the fabric).\n\nLearn to tackle stains on common fabrics and materials\n\nBaby and pet poop can affect any manner of objects from upholstery and carpeting to bedding, silk items, wool sweaters, your baby\u2019s toys, your dog\u2019s bed and on and on. The precise methods of cleaning will depend on the object that\u2019s involved, so try these tricks for specific materials:\n\nCotton\n\nPlastic\n\nFor baby toys and other plastic items, start with hot, soapy water and wash the affected item. Follow up by sanitizing or disinfecting (the Environmental Protection Agency offers a helpful PDF that explains proper procedure for sanitizing and disinfecting children\u2019s toys).\n\nRugs and carpeting\n\nFor your basic baby-poop-on-the-carpet event, clean with a combination of liquid dish soap, warm water and lots of blotting. Vinegar may prove helpful for stain-fighting. For a more complicated dog-poop-on-the-carpet event, a product called Nature\u2019s Miracle (an enzyme-based cleaner) may be effective at removing stains and odors.\n\nYour hands\n\nYou\u2019ve washed your hands repeatedly, but they STILL smell like poop. (It\u2019s OK, we\u2019ve all been there.) Washing your hands with liquid dish soap may help, or trying wiping your hands with rubbing alcohol swabs.\n\nSilk\n\nThe process of cleaning silk is similar to that of cleaning cotton except that you\u2019ll want to avoid enzyme-based cleaners. Sunshine is also recommended for stain removal on silk items.\n\nUpholstery\n\nCleaning upholstery can be similar to cleaning carpeting although initially treating with cold water is preferable to warm water if you want to avoid setting stains. For machine-washable sofa covers, follow up by laundering. Nature\u2019s Miracle may also be effective in the case of pet poop on your furniture.\n\nWool\n\nA cold-water soak is recommended for wool items. Then follow up with a thorough washing (avoid enzyme-based cleaners for wool products). Sunshine can be a good choice for removing stains from wool items.\n\nKeep these items on hand\n\nPaper towels\n\nPerfect for cleaning and disinfecting \u2014 paper towels are a lifesaver.\n\nRubber gloves\n\nEspecially helpful when cleaning dog poop. Plastic gloves eliminate the chance of getting poop on your hands, which is aways a plus!\n\nPatience\n\nRemoving stains takes time. Don\u2019t rush the process.\n\nA sense of humor\n\nRemember, this will be funny someday.\n\nA garbage can\n\nThere will come a time (and you\u2019ll know when) that an item is simply too gross to save \u2014 not recommended for the disposal of sofas.\n\nBonus cheat sheet of poop-removal and cleaning tips",

        "content": "When you've spent years portraying both a famed detective and a comic book superhero onscreen, you seem to learn a thing or two about leaping to action to fend off bad guys. The was the case when Benedict Cumberbatch saved a delivery cyclist from muggers, as reported by UK newspaper The Sun on Saturday, June 2.\n\nThe British actor \u2014 who has starred as both Sherlock Holmes in BBC's crime drama Sherlock and Doctor Strange in several Marvel films (most recently, this year's hit Avengers: Infinity War) \u2014 was reportedly in an Uber with wife Sophie Hunter in London last November when he spotted four men attacking a food delivery cyclist, according to Reuters..\n\n\u201cOne of the males attempted to grab the victim\u2019s cycle ... He was then punched in the face, struck on the head and hit with his helmet,\u201d the Metropolitan Police confirmed to Reuters in a statement.\n\nSpeaking to The Sun, the actor's Uber driver, Manuel Dias, further detailed the incident, which ironically took place near Sherlock Holmes fictional residence at 221B Baker Street, saying that the actor leapt from the car and shouted \u201cleave him alone,\u201d before dragging the men off of the victim.\n\nDias, who claimed he wasn't aware of the actor's identity at first, says he joined Cumberbatch in defending the delivery man from the attackers, who ultimately fled the scene: \u201cIt was only then I recognized Benedict. Then it all got a bit surreal. Here was Sherlock Holmes fighting off four attackers just round the corner from Baker Street.\"\n\nDavid Livingston/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nAccording to Reuters, the police said that no arrests have been made, but, fortunately, nothing was stolen and the victim did not require hospital treatment.\n\nStill, the driver had nothing but praise for the passenger he said he was taking to a London club that night. \u201cThe cyclist was lucky, Benedict\u2019s a superhero,\u201d he added. \u201cBenedict was courageous, brave and selfless. If he hadn\u2019t stepped in the cyclist could have been seriously injured.\u201d\n\nIn a stroke of pure modesty, the highly respected star, who's currently playing the title character in Showtime's drama miniseries Patrick Melrose, saw things a little bit differently though, insisting his actions weren't extraordinary. \u201cI did it out of, well, I had to, you know ,\u201d Cumberbatch told The Sun. You know, in case his fans weren't already swooning a ton.\n\nThe company that employed the cyclist, Deliveroo, tweeted their thanks to the father of two. \"Thank you Benedict Cumberbatch for your brave actions,\" the restaurant delivery service posted on their official account June 2. Deliveroo riders are heroes - their safety is our priority and any violence against them is totally unacceptable. So on behalf of everyone at deliveroo: thank you,\"\n\nMany other fans took to Twitter to praise Cumberbatch, noting how swoon-worthy his heroics truly were.\n\nYet others weren't exactly surprised that the Oscar nominee \"fought off some muggers\" because what can't Cumberbatch do, after all?\n\nAnother user pointed out how surreal the situation must have been for the cyclist: \"Can you imagine ... you look up and Benedict Cumberbatch has come to your rescue?\"\n\nSuggesting the muggers clearly weren't aware of his abilities, one tweeter added that it was a stupid idea for the muggers to attempt to commit a crime when \"Sherlock Holmes\" was nearby.\n\nAnother fan boldly suggested that the valiant \"#heroofthepeople\" be dubbed \"patron saint of cyclists.\"\n\nFinally, one satirical account joked that \"94% of Britons\" are considering a career change in hopes of also being rescued by the star. (Wait, what about the other 6%?)\n\nWhether he considers his brave actions to be praiseworthy or not, many agree that Cumberbatch is living proof that not all superheros wear capes \u2014 well, not when they're not working anyway.",

A month after the business mogul and Real Housewives of New York City star traveled to Puerto Rico with four planes packed with supplies for Hurricane Maria relief efforts, she's planning a return trip.\n\nIn fact, Frankel reveals she will spend her 47th birthday on Saturday on her return trip to help with continued hurricane relief.\n\n\"I'm going this weekend for my birthday to Puerto Rico. I don't usually love my birthday. I think it's an interesting way to give back on your birthday and a good way to reflect on my age and where I am,\" she told E!

They've been destroyed,\" Frankel said. \"Each disaster is its own sort of baby that needs to be nurtured. People forget about one and then move on to the rest so Puerto Rico is definitely a priority but so is the U.S. Virgin Islands.\"\n\nDuring her first charity trip, Frankel's B Strong organization partnered with Delivering GOod, Feeding America and Global Empowerment Mission to raise $25,000 in Costco giftcards, $25,000 cash and 15,000 pounds of food, water and medical supplies for Hurricane Maria victims in Puerto Rico.\n\nFrankel says she and her team have raised somewhere between $5 and $10 million for disaster relief, and she doesn't plan on slowing down anytime soon.\n\n\"I will not finish that charitable job until they're getting their footing,\" she shared with us.\n\nLast week, it was revealed that hundreds of Puerto Ricans have died since the hurricane, but their deaths were all attributed to \"natural causes.\"\n\nSpokesperson for Puerto Rico's Department of Public Safety, Karixia Ortiz Serrano, said that the 911 reported deaths after Hurricane Maria were not related to the hurricane, but BuzzFeed reports that none of the bodies were \"examined by a medical examiner for consideration to be included in the Maria death toll.\"\n\nSerrano stated that the classifications of death by \"natural causes\" were made by reviewing records and not inspection by medical examiners. She went on to share that the Puerto Rican government has \"no official guidelines on what qualifies as a hurricane-related death.\"\n\nWith the official hurricane-related death toll at 51 in Puerto Rico, more than 900 bodies were cremated before medical examiners got a chance to look at them.\n\nPhoto Credit: Instagram / @bethennyfrankel",

She stood up to her monster rapist and now she has to stand up to yet another monster, suicide. The suicide of her beloved lover and ally, Anthony Bourdain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI write these truths because I have been asked to. I know so many around the world thought of Anthony Bourdain as a friend and when a friend dies, it hurts. Many of these people who lost their \u2018friend\u2019 are wanting to lash out and blame. You must not sink to that level. Suicide is a horrible choice, but it is that person\u2019s choice,\u201d she added.\n\nJohn Nacion/Startraks\n\nBourdain began dating the Italian actress in 2017, after she appeared on an episode of Parts Unknown filmed in her hometown of Rome. She recently directed an upcoming episode set in Hong Kong, and Bourdain would often consult her for her rich knowledge of music and film when putting together the series.\n\nArgento was one of the dozens of women to accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault and harassment in 2017 (Weinstein has \u201cunequivocally\u201d denied \u201cany allegations of non-consensual sex\u201d). Bourdain became one of the most outspoken celebrities about the #MeToo era, showing unwavering support for his girlfriend, and even holding a dinner for Argento and fellow Weinstein accusers McGowan and Annabella Sciorra.\n\nAddressing the late chef\u2019s depression, McGowan continued, \u201cAnthony was open with his demons, he even wrote a book about them. In the beginning of their relationship, Anthony told a mutual friend, \u2018He\u2019s never met anyone who wanted to die more than him.\u2019 And through a lot of this last year, Asia did want the pain to stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut here\u2019s the thing, over their time together, thankfully, she did the work to get help, so she could stay alive and live another day for her and her children. Anthony\u2019s depression didn\u2019t let him, he put down his armor, and that was very much his choice. His decision, not hers. His depression won,\u201d she remarked.\n\nOpening up about the pair\u2019s \u201cfree relationship,\u201d McGowan wrote that \u201cwhen Anthony met Asia, it was instant chemistry. They laughed, they loved and he was her rock during the hardships of this last year.\u201d\n\nContinuing, she wrote that the pair \u201cloved without borders of traditional relationships, and they established the parameters of their relationship early on. Asia is a free bird, and so was Anthony. Was. Such a terrible word to write. I\u2019ve heard from many that the past two years they were together were some of his happiest and that should give us all solace.\u201d\n\nWhile Bourdain was shooting for Parts Unknown in France before his death, Argento was spotted holding hands with another man in Rome, according to TMZ.\n\nInvision/AP/REX/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cAnthony was 61, the same age my father was when he died. My father also suffered from intermittent deep depression, and like Anthony, was part of a \u2018pull up your bootstraps and march on\u2019 generation. The a \u2018strong man doesn\u2019t ask for help\u2019 generation,\u201d she wrote, adding that although Bourdain did reach out for help before taking his life, \u201che did not take the doctor\u2019s advice.\u201d\n\nShe also asked fans of the late chef and TV host to \u201cNOT do the sexist thing and burn a woman on the pyre of misplaced blame.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnthony\u2019s internal war was his war, but now she\u2019s been left on the battlefield to take the bullets. It is in no way fair or acceptable to blame her or anyone else, not even Anthony. We are asking you to be better, to look deeper, to read and learn about mental illness, suicide and depression before you make it worse for survivors by judging that which we do not understand, that which can never fully be understood. Sometimes we are stuck in the unknowable, and that is where we are now, a massive wave of darkness that threatens to swallow everyone in its wake,\u201d she added.\n\nVianney Le Caer/Invision/AP/REX/Shutterstock; Slaven Vlasic/Getty\n\nThe 44-year-old actress went on to implore anybody reading her open letter to \u201cjoin me in sending healing energy to Anthony on his journey, and to all who\u2019ve been left behind to journey on without him. There is no one to blame but the stigma of loneliness, the stigma of asking for help, the stigma of mental illness, the stigma of being famous and hurting,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe also added that \u201cAnthony would never have wanted Asia to be hurt,\u201d before urging anyone who might be considering suicide to seek help. \u201cWe need you here. You matter. You exist. You count. There is help a phone call away, reach out,\u201d she added.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Chefs like Anthony Bourdain Face Constant \u2018Behind-the-Scenes\u2019 Anxieties: \u2018When The Shift Stops What Do You Do?\u2019\n\nOn Friday, Bourdain was found unresponsive in his hotel room in Kaysersberg, France, by his close friend Eric Ripert, according to CNN. Both were filming an upcoming episode of Parts Unknown.\n\nSpeaking with PEOPLE, French prosecutor Christian de Rocquigny previously said there was no evidence of violence in Bourdain\u2019s death.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times hours after the news of Bourdain\u2019s death, his mother Gladys Bourdain said she had no indication that her son may have been thinking about suicide. However, following his death, she spoke to Ripert who told her that \u201cTony had been in a dark mood these past couple of days.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), text \u201chelp\u201d to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 or go to suicidepreventionlifeline.org.",

Recently, \u201csomeone went to Jennifer with new details that Alex was still texting with Lauren, and that\u2019s what made Jennifer lose it,\u201d the insider tells In Touch. \u201cOf course, he said it wasn\u2019t physical, and maybe it wasn\u2019t, but in Jennifer\u2019s book, that\u2019s still cheating. They were head-over-heels in love and planning to get engaged. Now Alex\u2019s actions have jeopardized everything.\u201d\n\nThe damage runs deep. Jennifer, who\u2019s endured three failed marriages, \u201cwas heartbroken to hear that Alex was talking to Lauren,\u201d says the insider. \u201cEven though they didn\u2019t meet in person, Jennifer considered it a betrayal. Now she has friends and family watching out for her best interests, which means checking in and asking about Alex\u2019s antics.\u201d\n\nShe has good reason to worry. Last June, a month after Jennifer and Alex made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala in NYC, Lauren claimed in a bombshell interview that she was in frequent contact with the ex-athlete, whom she met at an Equinox gym in 2011. \u201cA week before his relationship with Jennifer was announced, he was asking me to go to Miami,\u201d she claimed. \u201cHe never even mentioned her.\u201d Lauren also alleged that Alex (who has kids Natasha, 13, and Ella, 9, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis) cheated on then-girlfriend Cameron Diaz with her in 2011. Jennifer \u201cwould be an idiot to believe he\u2019d be faithful,\u201d she said. She also called Jennifer too vanilla for him. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s sexually attracted to her,\u201d she dished. \u201cIn bed\u2026 he\u2019s probably picturing me.\u201d\n\nJennifer, mom to nine-year-old twins Max and Emme with ex Marc Anthony, turned a blind eye to the initial interview. Now, she\u2019s not sure what to believe. \u201cJennifer\u2019s still on the fence,\u201d says the insider. \u201cShe can either cut her losses and walk away from the relationship, or she can fight for it. I think she\u2019ll fight for it.\u201d",

On Thursday's Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, she opened up about the rumors that she dated Brad Pitt, confessing that she didn't exactly mind seeing herself and the 54-year-old actor together in the tabloids.\n\n\"I\u2019ve met him once in like 2013, so it was very random,\u201d Lawrence said with a laugh. \u201cBut, I also wasn\u2019t, like, in a huge hurry to debunk it!\u201d\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:",

It was heartbreak,\u201d Dorfman told ABC News\u2019 \u201cNightline.\u201d\n\nIn her new book, \u201cIt\u2019s Not Okay,\u201d Dorfman is now pulling back the curtain on her life in the \u201cBachelorette\u201d bubble and revealing her version of the details surrounding her failed engagement, including why she set some of the things Murray had given her on fire after their break-up.\n\nDorfman first stepped onto the \u201cBachelor\u201d/\u201dBachelorette\u201d scene as one of 27 women vying for the heart of \u201cBachelor\u201d Juan Pablo before becoming a \u201cBachelorette\u201d herself.\n\nDuring her season as the Bachelorette, Dorfman, 29, fell head over heels for Murray, a then 29-year-old former baseball player, and the two got engaged.\n\nAfter filming wrapped she said, \u201cI was so comfortable with Josh at that point... It felt like we were there and that everyone else were strangers. But I will say I remember after they yelled, \u2018Cut\u2019 ... they gave us our cell phones, and the first thing I did was get his number. And I said, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m getting my fianc\u00e9\u2019s number for the first time.\u2019 ... So, things like that are kind of funny.\u201d\n\nIn her book, Dorfman dishes about the scandalous \u201cFantasy Suite,\u201d where she hooked up with the two men she was considering, Murray and Nick Viall. Dorfman said she was blindsided by the backlash she received over having sex in the Fantasy Suite twice.\n\n\u201cI was at a point where I felt deeply for these two men,\u201d Dorfman said. \u201cEvery woman who is 27 years old that is looking to be with a man for the rest of their life that has dated them for seven weeks and met their family and been told that they\u2019re loved by them and had these intimate experiences outside the bedroom, probably feels like they can extend that intimacy into the bedroom.\u201d\n\nIn the end, she chose Murray, but off-camera, Dorfman said their relationship started to fall apart. She said Murray didn\u2019t know how to handle her independence.\n\n\u201cI started to change. I think I blame myself for not standing up for my independence. But [there were] little things, like not being able to see my friends as often or feeling like my whereabouts were kind of always in question,\u201d she said. \u201cI had never felt worse about myself. ... I didn\u2019t like who I was. I didn\u2019t like how I felt on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nAfter months of bickering, they both decided to end it. The newly-minted reality show starlet found herself in a painfully public break-up and Dorfman said it was hard for her to even leave the house at first.\n\n\u201cI literally slept until noon every day at which point I would watch TV,\u201d she said. \"I\u2019d loaf around [in] yoga pants and [a] smelly t-shirt. I\u2019d drink wine. I was just a loser, in a sense.\u201d\n\nIt took Dorfman weeks to build up the courage to go back to the home they shared in Georgia and get her things. When she got there, she said she found a pile of her belongings, including things Murray had given her, sitting in a corner.\n\n\u201cThat, I think, will never escape me -- just that feeling of having a home that you shared with someone and just everything be piled up and that feeling of just being disposable,\u201d she said.\n\nFueled with anger, Dorfman said she threw everything that reminded her of Murray into the fireplace and set them on fire.\n\n\u201cWas it the most mature approach? No, but that\u2019s the point. I think that on TV I always felt this need to be my best, and I wasn\u2019t at my best when I was going through a breakup and that\u2019s just the truth,\u201d Dorfman said. \u201cSometimes you have to embrace weakness. You have to recognize that you\u2019re not going to be at your best every single day.\u201d\n\nBut even after the heartache, Dorfman said she wouldn\u2019t change a thing about her relationship with Murray.\n\n\u201cI almost don\u2019t want to know whether [what we had] was real because I know what I felt during those eight weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cThe day I got engaged was, to this day, the happiest day of my life. I want to deny it in a sense because it didn\u2019t work out, but if I\u2019m being truthful about it, that was the happiest day of my life.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, Murray said, \"How is one supposed to comment on a fictional novel? I choose to go through life building others up, not tearing them down. I wish her nothing but the best in her new career.\"\n\nDorfman is now single and living in New York City. She says she wants to keep writing and try being a bachelorette in the city.\n\n\u201cI just have fun here. I have fun with my girlfriends and like soaking so much of New York,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s scary in a sense but ... I have nothing to lose and everything to gain, it\u2019s kind of like the silver lining of heartbreak.\u201d",

He will be greatly missed by many, including his wife Crystal, my sister Christie and my brothers David and Marston, and all of us at Playboy Enterprises,\u201d said Cooper.\n\nHefner quickly rose to fame after the first issue of men\u2019s magazine Playboy published in December 1953, which featured a nude Marilyn Monroe. The same year, Hefner launched media and lifestyle company Playboy Enterprises, Inc., on which he served as a board member until the time of his death.\n\nIn an August 2017 interview, Hefner\u2019s son Cooper, who took over as chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises, admitted that it was hard to watch his father get older.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to watch him struggle,\u201d he told The Hollywood Reporter of his father getting older. \u201cBut I\u2019m just happy it\u2019s physical and not mental.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Crystal Harris and four children.",

Carrey left the series following the release of his massive hit films Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, The Mask and Dumb and Dumber, which all came out in his final year on the show.\n\nBut Carrey said there was one memory he had from the made-for-TV movie Mike Hammer: Murder Takes All, which he shot alongside veteran film and TV star Stacy Keach back in 1989, that really gave him a passion for acting that he's never forgotten.\n\n\"[In one scene] I had just hid behind a door [and] I remember looking over at Stacy Keach on the other side of the door and on action we were both supposed to burst out through the door and run for the car,\" Carrey recalled. \"I was on one side of the door with a gun and he was on the other side of the door with a gun and he looked at me and I looked at him and just for a split second there was a really conscious kind of connection over the idea that we are grown men, pretending to have guns, and that we're going to run into a spray of gunfire.\"\n\n\"It felt really ridiculous and it's really never felt like anything but that since,\" Carrey added.\n\nIn Kidding, Carrey stars as Jeff, a children's television icon who goes by the name Mr. Pickles (and was created in the vein of Mr. Rogers), and who has been a guiding beacon of hope and happiness for America's children for generations.\n\nHowever, as Jeff's life implodes around him and the pressures of his fame begin to feel stifling, he suffers an emotional collapse and spirals into a very complicated and public madness.\n\nHelmed by the deft directorial hand of Michel Gondry, who previously worked with Carrey on the acclaimed 2004 dramedy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and earned accolades for his films The Science of Sleep and Be King Rewind, Kidding has a chaotic complexity and layered, post-surreal quality that even its stars have trouble explaining succinctly.\n\n\"There's a tragedy but it's not about a tragedy,\" Greer reflected. \"You talk about the innocence and finding the innocence within you that we try so hard to build these walls around, but really we're all ourselves as children inside.\"\n\n\"It's about what happens in the lightning storm when you get hit, when the family gets hit by lightning,\" Carrey added. \"And the lighting is meant to be. There's something about it that's meant to be, that is the craziest, hairiest blessing that could ever happen.\"\n\nCarrey added that, while his character has something of a nervous breakdown in the series, the show is actually \"about a nervous breakthrough.\"\n\nKidding premieres Sept. 9 on Showtime.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:",

        "content": "[This story contains spoilers from the March 14 episode of The X-Files.]\n\nWhen first-time The X-Files scribe Karen Nielsen wrote Wednesday\u2019s episode, \u201cNothing Lasts Forever,\u201d she set out to tell a character-based piece.\n\n\u201cI wanted to have some character moments with Mulder and Scully \u2014 that was super important to me,\u201d says Nielsen. \u201cI thought it would be interesting to have Scully reflecting on her religion. My sister is very Catholic, and I\u2019m not. So I liked the dynamic of Scully being very Catholic and Mulder not; I related to that.\u201d\n\nWhat Nielsen didn\u2019t know at the time was that her episode would shift back one to become the penultimate episode of the season and potentially the series as a whole. Wednesday\u2019s episode revolved around a cult led by a former actress (Fiona Vroom) who was obsessed with maintaining their youth and the woman (Carlena Britch) trying to save her sister from them. The installment also could be the last \u201cmonster of the week\u201d episode the iconic series does with its core team intact as star Gillian Anderson has said this will be her final year playing Scully.\n\n\u201cThe pressure that society puts on women to be perfect, to be beautiful is intense, because we\u2019re such a consumerism society that we have to prey off of women\u2019s insecurity to sell, sell, sell,\u201d Nielsen says. The writer, who doubles as the show\u2019s script coordinator, also made sure the female characters were well-rounded and the episode also featured an inclusive cast. \u201cEspecially in Hollywood, you\u2019re a write-off after 30. That pressure is quadrupled as an actress. That was a horrible and wonderful rabbit hole to go down [in writing]: having an actress try to hold on to her youth and obtaining that.\u201d\n\nNielsen credits longtime X-Files writers James Wong (who directed the hour) and Glen Morgan with being the genesis of Scully\u2019s (Gillian Anderson) religious origin story in the episode. When Scully was younger, her brother was sick, and her mother asked the family to pray for him. The first few days, a young Scully asked for a puppy \u2026 which she got shortly after her brother recovered. \u201cIt was the architecture of Jim and Glen knowing this character for so long, and seeing the things that she should be coming from,\u201d she says, calling the duo her \u201cdream team\u201d collaborators. Morgan was also the one to suggest they have a visual callback to the mysterious coin Scully\u2019s mother had on her when she died last season.\n\nThe hour ended up being pivotal for Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully, whose relationship has grown increasingly murky. The dynamic duo\u2019s partnership was always complicated during the original run of the series: after years of closeness, they slept together in season seven \u2014 a move that appeared to be responsible for the conception of Scully\u2019s son, William \u2014 but due to outside forces (and Duchovny\u2019s increased absence from the franchise) they were never properly a couple. The second feature film, The X-Files: I Want to Believe, found the two living together, away from the FBI life, but there was obvious tension in the relationship as they worked the movie\u2019s case; they were broken up by the 2016 television revival.\n\nHowever, they appeared to potentially reconcile early in season 11, when they slept together and arranged a couple of dates. But in true Mulder and Scully fashion, they simply seemed to be existing together (they still reside in separate homes, for instance) versus actively engaging the shift in their relationship and what it could mean. But Scully took a step forward to break them out of their standstill in the final scene of the episode: when Mulder mentioned they were good together, she simply asked, \u201cAre we together?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo me it was about having a honest moment,\u201d Nielsen says, acknowledging the open conversation between the two was part of why the episode moved directly pre-finale. \u201cWe need to be real, we need to be honest, we need to start saying something. They\u2019ve gone through so many emotional things with their son, coming back to the X-Files and things not going so smoothly. And [also] coming back to the relationship, because they were away from it for so long; to see where that relationship sits now. It\u2019s exhausting not being honest when you get to that stage. To be true to these characters, you had to have a true moment. It\u2019s what those characters needed.\u201d\n\nBut what was it that Scully needs? \u201cI don\u2019t know if any God is listening, but I am standing right here,\u201d Mulder told his partner. \u201cAnd I am listening. Right besides you, all ears. That\u2019s my choice.\u201d She paused, looked around at the empty church, before whispering her hope for her future in his ear. \u201cThat\u2019s not my 4-year-old self looking for a miracle,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s my leap of faith forward. And I\u2019d like to do it together.\u201d\n\nThe audience is in the dark about Scully\u2019s request during the hour, intentionally. \u201cThat\u2019s between Mulder and Scully,\u201d Nielsen notes. \u201cHaving those private moments, it\u2019s important for any couple.\u201d And it won\u2019t be revealed going forward, either: \u201cIt\u2019ll always be between Mulder and Scully,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s not for anyone else. That was their moment.\u201d (Chalk it up to another unsolved mystery, a la the duo\u2019s Christmas gifts to each other.)\n\nWith that exact sentiment remaining unspoken, it was essential the tone be handled correctly while filming the scene. \u201cIt\u2019s just [them] being honest with each other,\u201d Nielsen notes. \u201cWhen you\u2019re used to having that playful banter with someone, when they\u2019re suddenly honest, it takes you aback. It\u2019s, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re actually going to have a real conversation about this.\u2019 Sometimes those things can be scary. It was something from the heart, which can be terrifying for her to do, especially given how much she\u2019s been through and how much her heart has been broken, especially this season. That\u2019s where I wanted it to come from: her vulnerability.\u201d\n\nAnd, yes, in Nielsen\u2019s mind, Mulder and Scully are meant to be together. \u201cI feel like they\u2019re each other\u2019s soulmates and they know it,\u201d she says. \u201cThey get in each other\u2019s way, they\u2019re complicated, they both have reasons why they hold back. They both have reasons they need each other. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve had such an up and down relationship: it\u2019s not as easy as saying, \u2018I like you, let\u2019s make this work.\u2019 The world they live in just doesn\u2019t allow for that. Their love for each other, mind and body, makes them go, \u2018There\u2019s nobody else.\u2019 There are so many moments you see them, they look at each other, and just from a look, [it\u2019s] no one will get me like you do. That\u2019s my personal take on it: they\u2019re soulmates.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think Scully whispered to Mulder?",

At the time, Apatow was a producer.\n\n\"I wasn't attracted to nice boys at the time,\" Mann told ABC News. \"I was at the tail end of that stage. And then Judd somehow worked his way into my life, and it just kind of hit me. It was a great day when I finally realized what was right in front of me.\"\n\nSince then, Mann has starred in several of Apatow's films, gradually taking on larger roles.\n\nBut what kinds of romance movies does Mann most like to watch? Her answers may surprise you.\n\nRecently, Mann shared her five favorite romantic flicks with ABCNews.com -- and they aren't your typical love stories.\n\nWhen ranking romantic comedies, most people probably wouldn't put this 1971 cult classic on their list. But the unique love story definitely delivers romance in addition to dark, slapstick comedy. \"Harold and Maude\" follows the relationship between Harold, a 19-year-old who has a fascination with faking his own death, and Maude, a 79-year-old free spirit who dabbles in things such as stealing hearses and modeling nude for ice sculptures.",

Find your cheekbones, and slide the pigment just below them in a downward motion. \"It should end a couple of inches away from the corner of your mouth,\" Turnbow says.\n\nProduct used: Kevyn Aucoin The Sculpting Powder ($44; sephora.com)\n\nNext, apply your concealer. \"It should create a halo effect around your eyes,\" Turnbow says. Use your fingers to pat it on along the tops of your cheekbones. Then, bring it up until it reaches just above the tip of your eyebrows. \"Look for a concealer with a radiant aspect to it,\" she says. \"This will help attract the light.\"\n\nProduct used: NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer, ($29; nars.com)\n\nFor your nose contour, use the same shadow you swept under your cheekbones. Focus it along the two edges of the bone. \"Start right under the ends of your brows, and bring it down to the tips,\" Turnbow says.\n\nYour concealer should sit in the center of your nose. Swipe it in a downward motion, to the tip. Then, blend your three lines together. \"When you blend, make sure you're still able to see the product,\" Turnbow says. \"People tend to over-blend and erase the work they just did. Instead, just blur the edges so that they're less noticeable, but still there.\"\n\nThe result is bright, beautiful, and so easy to do.

One guest was later seen telling guests that she had picked up Charlotte\u2019s heart shaped floral garland, which she had mislaid.\n\nREAD: Newlyweds Pippa Middleton and James Matthews celebrate with a kiss\n\n\u00a9 Photo: Getty Images\n\nDuchess Kate helps the bridesmaids and pageboys at the wedding\n\nThe royal family traditionally have a large bridal party of young bridesmaids and pageboys at weddings. When Duchess Kate married Prince William in 2011, Kate was joined by a charming group of four bridesmaids and two pageboys. The Duchess\u2019s bridesmaids, like Pippa\u2019s, also wore pretty flower crowns on their heads for the wedding ceremony. Although not a royal wedding, Pippa seems to be following in her sister\u2019s footsteps. All the children in the bridal party behaved beautifully at the wedding of Pippa and James, all be it with a gentle \u2018shhh\u2019 signal from Kate as they entered the church. The Duchess was photographed placing her finger on her mouth to show the young bridal party it was time to quieten down.\n\n\u00a9 Photo: Rex\n\nPrincess Charlotte and Prince George with their mother Kate\n\nThe Duchess had previously expressed concern about her children George and Charlotte, who had starring roles on the big day. At the Queen's garden party earlier this week, Kate told one guest that she was \"a bit worried\" about how they would behave at the ceremony. Partygoer Andrew Bates said: \"[Kate] said that they were all really looking forward to her sister's wedding at the weekend but she was a bit worried about how her children might behave. She said she was hopeful that they would be good but you never know at that age.\" For all the best photos and coverage of Pippa's big day, stay tuned to hellomagazine.com and pick up the souvenir edition of HELLO! magazine out on Monday.",

Nick Cannon hosted the show for eight seasons, but he quit after Season 12 (and was later replaced by Tyra Banks) after NBC threatened to fire him for ridiculing the network in his Showtime comedy special Stand Up, Don\u2019t Shoot. Speaking to Yahoo Entertainment a year after the scandal, Cannon says he has no regrets and calls the move \u201cprobably one of the best decisions\u201d of his career.\n\n\u201cIt was super-controversial for some time \u2026 but it was a freedom-of-speech process and me standing firm for my own beliefs and culturally who I am, and really for all the employees who have been thumb-pressed by their bosses,\u201d Cannon says, discussing the importance of adhering to his brand. \u201cI kind of stood up and said, \u2018Yo, I was threatened for some content that I created.\u2019 And they wanted me to shape up and get in line and watch my choice of words or how I speak about the network. \u2026 I was threatened to be fired. I told them, \u2018You can\u2019t fire a boss. I quit!\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the time, Cannon\u2019s choosing to walk away from a reported $4.5 million paycheck shocked his fans, and even people in his camp thought Cannon was making a mistake. \u201cPeople on my own team, people that were with me, man, like they scared for me,\u201d he says, chuckling. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Yo, that job doesn\u2019t define me.\u2019 \u2026 As an artist, that was a self-defining moment, because a lot of people was like, \u2018How can you walk away from such an amazing job? You\u2019re the No. 1 host on television, highest-paid,\u2019 all of that stuff. And I was like, \u2018None of that stuff matters to me. I\u2019m an artist, and it\u2019s not about money. It\u2019s about having my own self-worth.\u201d\n\nSince wrapping his final AGT season in 2016, Cannon certainly hasn\u2019t slowed down. He\u2019s been working on the 11th season of his comedy game show Wild \u2018N Out, studying in his \u201cspare time\u201d at Howard University, and, most important, releasing new music.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve probably made so much more money since walking away from [AGT] and doing it the way that I wanted to do it. I\u2019m almost like, \u2018Man, I should\u2019ve stepped away earlier,\u2019\u201d Cannon says. \u201cYou ever had those decisions where you\u2019re kind of in your comfort zone and so you kind of go about the mundane process, and as soon as you step out of your comfort zone it\u2019s all of this freedom and the universe starts to just throw so many things in your direction? That\u2019s what happened. I\u2019m elated with everything that I\u2019ve been doing since I stepped away from America\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nFollow Lyndsey on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Amazon, Tumblr, Spotify",

It's not about weight,\" she shares. \"I've never even weighed myself. I don't think you can trust the scale.\"\n\n\"Exercise is about how I feel. I have more energy when I work out. It makes me amped for the rest of the day, and I feel strong,\" she added.\n\nMark Williams + Sara Hirakawa/SHAPE\n\nAs much as she loves to exercise, the 30-year-old actress also loves to indulge, admitting that she's all about creating balance in her life.\n\n\"I think having healthy skin [also] comes from being happy and having a balanced life. I work hard, I play hard; I eat a lot, I work out a lot,\" she says. \"I'm not the kind of person who says 'I eat pizza' but then doesn't really eat it. I eat the pizza! And I don't stress out about it.\"\n\n\"I've learned that as long as you're moving, you can have the food you want,\" she continues. \"Every one of us has insecurities. I have a whole bunch of them, but I don\u2019t dwell on them. Instead I focus on my strengths. After all, what\u2019s the worst thing that can happen if you try something new and it doesn\u2019t work out? So what?\"\n\nThat confidence has allowed Mitchell to pursue different opportunities, no matter how much they may scare her. \"You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to be good at until you do it! The same goes for travel: Explore the world; don\u2019t be afraid of it. Get out there and be adventurous -- that\u2019s my life motto,\" she expresses.\n\nSee more on Mitchell in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:",

But behind the scenes, the financial situation of many models who walk in New York Fashion Week isn't as glamorous as it seems.\n\nModels who manage to become household names command high rates for their work. The 10 highest-paid models made a collective $109.5 million between June 2016 and June 2017, according to Forbes.\n\nThe top spot on the most recent list went to 22-year-old Kendall Jenner, who earned a total of $22 million. That's more than double the $10 million Jenner, who has over 85 million Instagram followers, made the year before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGisele B\u00fcndchen, 37, was the second-highest paid model with $17.5 million in earnings. She came in first on the 2016 Forbes list, with $30.5 million.\n\nFor the rest of the industry, which the Council of Fashion Designers of America has said is \"in transition,\" the financial story is much different. While many models have closets filled with expensive clothes \u2014 often received as payment for their work \u2014 most do not have bank accounts to match.\n\nIn New York, models earn $48,130 on average, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's only a third of the average annual Manhattanite salary of $144,716.\n\n\"Models\u2014many of whom are minors\u2014have low bargaining power and are frequently not paid all of their earned wages, are paid wages late, are paid only after complaining about non-payment, are paid in 'trade' instead of money, or are simply not paid at all,\" former model and founder and executive director of the Models Alliance, Sara Ziff, told The Daily Beast's Miranda Frum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelly Mittendorf, 23, who retired from modeling in 2015 after spending five years in the industry, recently spoke to the New York Times about her experience. Here's Mittendorf:\n\n\"I never made good money as a model. I went into debt with every single one of my agencies at one point or another. An agency has for each girl an account, and if they need to have the girl come from Arizona to New York in order to build her portfolio, the agency will front the expenses for her plane ticket, for paying the photographers, for printing the photos, for the physical portfolio itself, for the comp cards that need to be developed, for the retouching, for new clothes to go on castings with, for a model apartment for her to stay in.\"\n\nWhile there's no guarantee that a model's career earnings will justify the upfront costs, one way or another she is required to repay the agency. In Mittendorf's case, that amounted to five figures of debt.\n\n\"I was lucky to kind of be able to climb out of that,\" she told the New York Times. \"It took years.\"",

I mean, aside from being phenomenal as Cheryl Blossom in Riverdale, Petsch is also a makeup and skin addict, talking quite candidly about her beauty routine in interviews. The most recent product favorite of Petsch\u2019s? A $14 eyebrow gel. Yes, that's finally something you can afford.\n\nThe Details\n\nIn a video posted to her YouTube channel, Petsch broke down her summer beauty look with a makeup tutorial, showing fans exactly how she conceals her skin (with Tarte Shape Tape, of course), contours her eyes (with Wander Beauty Catch the Light Highlighter), and, of course, fills in her signature thick brows. Her favorite product? Pacifica Stunning Brows Eyebrow Gloss in Golden Brown.\n\n\"It's a really nice, cruelty-free brand,\u201d says Petsch in the video, before applying the gel. \u201cI kinda just lightly brush the hairs up for a nice full brow that I don't have naturally.\" And unlike brow gels that tend to be gloopy or thick (you know\u2014the ones that leave marks on your brow bones), Pacifica\u2019s formula is lightweight and relatively sheer, using sunflower seed oil to smooth hair and add shine, along with a sheer does of golden-brown pigments for color.\n\n(Image credit: Courtesy of Brand)\n\nBasically, if you\u2019re looking for a subtle wash of color across your brows, this formula is an excellent pick. Still, because it doesn\u2019t contain any thickening fibers (like many brow gels do), I\u2019d recommend filling in your brows with a pencil or powder, first, to define the shape and add some bulk.\n\nWatch the rest of Petsch\u2019s tutorial, below, and then recreate the look on yourself! I can\u2019t promise you\u2019ll look like a Riverdale star by the time you\u2019re done, but, hey, it can\u2019t hurt to try.",

But alas the OG peach is returning to the reality series for Season 10 with more fierceness and shadiness than ever before. But after two seasons have come and gone without her, you may be wondering: why is NeNe coming back to RHOA now?\n\nThe explanation for her return is quite simple. NeNe says that she's rejoining the cast for the benefit of her loyal fans. After the network made the official announcement in June 2017 that she was returning to the hit series, NeNe took to Bravo's The Daily Dish in praise of what all of the RHOA love has meant to her over the years. \"I just want to be the person to finally say to my fans who have supported me for so many years... I'm back and ready for Season 10. Let the shade begin, hunni!\" she said.\n\nFans first met the outspoken NeNe in the very first season of RHOA. With her blonde hair and dramatic personality she turned heads whenever she entered a room. From the beginning of the series she was a favorite, as she never hesitated to say exactly what was on her mind. She provided the utmost entertainment through her many witty quotes, comebacks, and side-eye before letting fans know that she sadly wouldn't return for season 8. Though, many fans have continued using her dramatic GIFS, memes, and one-liners in her absence. So she was gone, but not forgotten.\n\nIn 2015 she told People that leaving the show felt like a weight had \"been lifted off of [her] shoulders.\" That's no surprise being that most of the drama and arguments centered around NeNe. But in her defense she didn't start all of them. Nonetheless, NeNe officially traded in her peach in 2015.\n\n\u201cThis was definitely a hard decision for me,\u201d Leakes told People at the time. \u201cMe and my husband [Gregg Leakes] have been going back and forth on it for weeks now. But my contract is up and I just think this is the right time. This is my opportunity to spread my wings and do different things.\u201d The announcement for her departure came on the heels of news that Leakes would be focusing on other projects. She had previously guest starred on the hit FOX series Glee and NBC's The New Normal. Soon after leaving RHOA she made her Broadway debut as the wicked stepmother in Cinderella, alongside actress Keke Palmer.\n\nBut regardless of why she originally left the reality series, longtime RHOA viewers are super excited to see NeNe back in the group. She'll be reuniting with fellow Housewives Kenya Moore, Cynthia Bailey, Kandi Burruss, Shere\u00e9 Whitfield, and Porsha Williams. Also returning to the show, both in a part-time capacity, are Kim Zolciak-Biermann and newcomer model-actor Eva Marcille. Kim was an original Housewife along with NeNe, but unlike Kim, NeNe will resume her place as a full-time Housewife when the series returns on Sunday, Nov. 5.\n\nNBC/Bravo\n\n\"I am back and of course the haters know I'm here,\" NeNe says in Season 10 trailer, which means Atlanta (and particularly Porsha) better watch out. In an exclusive sneak peek on Entertainment Tonight, NeNe wastes no time inserting herself back into the drama when she candidly confronts Porsha over some nasty comments and bad blood at Cynthia's 50th birthday party. And anyone who remembers NeNe's previous seasons on the show knows that she's not one to back down from a (verbal) fight.\n\nSo how will this crew of Southern Belles get along with NeNe back in the building? Find out when RHOA returns for Season 10.",

        "content": "Tuesday\u2019s episode of American Horror Story: Cult, which was set to feature a scene in which a mass shooting occurs, has been edited to be less graphic following the deadly Las Vegas shooting in which 58 people were killed and hundreds more injured.\n\nRyan Murphy, co-creator and showrunner of the FX horror anthology, first made the comments Saturday during a New Yorker Festival discussion. The scene in question was filmed before the shooting in Las Vegas occurred, with Murphy explaining that they shot the sequence in September even though they\u2019re still filming this season (several of the actors have already wrapped). \u201cI just made the decision that I\u2019m going to have all of that violence be shown for the most part off camera,\u201d he said of editing the episode after it was in the can and locked before the tragedy in Vegas.\n\nOn Monday, FX confirmed the episode would see \u201csubstantial\u201d edits for Tuesday\u2019s telecast but that the original unedited episode would then be released on VOD and streaming platforms.\n\n\u201cIn light of the tragedy last week in Las Vegas, Ryan Murphy and the producers of American Horror Story: Cult have chosen to make substantial edits to the opening scene of [Tuesday] night\u2019s episode,\u201d FX said in a statement. \u201cThis opening, which was filmed two months ago and which portrays an occurrence of gun violence that has sadly become all too common in our country, contains a sequence that some viewers might find traumatic.\u201d\n\nThe network says the edited episode will air on the FX linear channel, while the unedited and original version will be available on the VOD platform of cable, satellite or telco providers, as well as on the FX Networks non-linear platforms, FXNOW and FX+.\n\nWhen speaking about the decision on Saturday with the New Yorker TV critic Emily Nussbaum, Murphy said he felt a \u201cresponsibility\u201d to victims of gun violence.\n\n\u201cNobody ever talks about victims\u2019 rights. That\u2019s sort of a weird emotional discussion that\u2019s never bridged,\u201d Murphy added. \u201cBut I felt great sympathy for people who were affected, certainly, and family members and loved ones and people who are upset about the way the world is.\u201d\n\nMurphy explained that there was a conversation about what to do with the AHS episode in the wake of the shooting: \u201cShould you air it? Should you not air it? How do you be sensitive?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy point of view was I believe I have the right to air it, but I also believe in victims\u2019 rights, and I believe that now is probably not the week to have something explosive or incendiary in the culture because someone who was affected might watch that and it could trigger something or make them feel upset. So our decision was to re-edit it and I felt that that was the right move,\u201d he said.\n\nThe scene was graphic, Murphy said, in order to make \u201can obvious anti-gun warning about society.\u201d\n\nThe seventh season of the horror anthology show, which stars Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters, follows the rise of a cult led by Peters\u2019 fictional character. The post-election set season explores how someone can rise within a disenfranchised community. Throughout the season, Peters will embody five other notorious real-life cult leaders, from Charles Manson to David Koresh.\n\nThis is not the first time a show has had to change a scene or delay the viewing of an episode in response to real-world events. USA\u2019s Mr. Robot delayed its season-one finale, which featured a character killing themselves on television, similar to the events of the Virginia TV shooting in which a reporter was killed on-air.\n\nSimilarly, USA delayed the premiere of its Ryan Phillippe-starrer Shooter in the wake of a deadly Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas where a sniper attack by a disgraced military vet killed five police officers.\n\nMurphy\u2019s comments were part of a wide-ranging discussion of his career and many TV series, past, present and future. He revealed the fate of the Cult episode as part of a response to a question from Nussbaum about people being offended by things on his shows and what offends him.\n\nOct. 9, 10:15 a.m.: Updated with Monday FX statement",

Her journey to fame was a long and turbulent one, and so was her love life. After one unsuccessful marriage, the artist has been dating country music artist Blake Shelton since 2015. The happy couple met on The Voice US. Although they got engaged, there have been rumors that Gwen called off the wedding because of \u2018cheating rumors\u2019. But, is this even true? You are about to find out in detail.\n\nGwen Stafani is an iconic figure in the world of music and show business, but how did she become so famous and adored? It was actually a long journey for her.\n\nGwen Ren\u00e9e Stefani was born on October 3, 1969, and she is not only a singer. Stefani is also a fashion designer, actress, and television personality!\n\nRemember her band No Doubt? That was her first start. Gwen was the co-creator and the lead singer of the band.\n\nThe band rose to fame in the mid-90s when they released their hit album Tragic Kingdom in 1995. Their hits included Just a Girl, Don\u2019t Speak, Hey Baby and It\u2019s My Life!\n\nShe soon found love in 1995, when she met Gavin on tour.\n\nThey got married in 2002.\n\nSadly, they divorced in 2016.\n\nThe couple has three children, but after 14 years of marriage, they divorced because of \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d.\n\nRumor had it what Gavin cheated on her with their nanny, Australian lady Mindy Mann.\n\nIn March of 2016, Gavin opened up about the breakdown in his relationship. He added that their divorce caused him \u201ca lot of pain and sadness\u201d.\n\nGavin said in an interview:\n\n\u201cIt really teaches you perspective on life. It\u2019s really health, happiness, and safety. After that, I don\u2019t know what there is other than that.\u201d\n\nAfter the divorce, Gwen found love once again.\n\nShe has been dating artist Blake Shelton since 2015.\n\nThey have been together for almost three years now. There was also a pregnancy rumor in 2017.\n\nAccording to Auntyacid, a source said:\n\n\u201cThey will get married one day but right now they are hyper-focused on getting pregnant. They believe there is still a chance for Gwen [to fall pregnant]. They are incredibly hopeful. Gwen and Blake started talking quickly about having a baby, but starting a family has not been easy for them. It\u2019s something that they really want and it\u2019s just not working out the way they wanted it to.\u201d\n\nThe source goes on:\n\n\u201cBlake told Gwen he does want kids of his own and Gwen was willing to try. With her, Blake has the exact relationship and family life he\u2019d hoped to have with Miranda. Gwen\u2019s everything he wants. They are so committed to one another.\u201d\n\nThe pair then got engaged.\n\nBut after months of planning and thinking about having the wedding in June, Gwen allegedly called the wedding off.\n\nThe rumors said that the mother-of-three called it off after worrying that Shelton had been unfaithful.\n\nAccording to a source, this confrontation caused a huge fight, and Gwen said there won\u2019t be a wedding.\n\nThe singer allegedly started feeling insecure and was bothered by the closeness of Blake and last year\u2019s The Voice winner Chloe Kohanski.\n\nChloe was on Blake\u2019s team, and Gwen saw more than a student-teacher relationship in them.\n\nA source went on to explain:\n\n\u201cShe started panicking about all the details \u2014 and about her future with Blake. Gwen and Blake had a massive fight and Gwen called off the wedding.\u201d\n\n\u201cGwen feels as if she loves Blake more than Blake loves her right now. She told Blake all about her insecurities and how she couldn\u2019t handle another heartbreaking divorce because of trust issues she needs to face.\u201d\n\nSources also claim that now they are trying to work things out.\n\n\u201cMost friends believe they will still walk down the aisle someday, but Gwen and Blake have some things to work on first. Trust is important and this isn\u2019t the right time for a dream wedding. The last thing Gwen or Blake wants is another divorce.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to the rumor-busting website, Gossip Cop, these rumors are false!\n\nThe website claims that Stefani and Shelton are not at war over Kohanski and that Stef\u2019s rep told them the wedding is not off.\n\nAccording to the rep, the couple\u2019s relationship is not \u201con the rocks.\u201d\n\nThe site also adds that Chloe has a boyfriend.\n\nThe outlet also claims that Gwen isn\u2019t insecure at all.\n\nFans simply don\u2019t know who to believe right now, but one thing is for sure. Gwen and Blake are still together, and the pair went on a family holiday just before the new year.\n\nThey spent some quality time together with Gwen\u2019s kids.\n\nBlake even taught them how to drive in a field full of mud! Moreover, they have also been spotted on a holiday in Mexico.\n\nGwen uploaded a photo to Instagram on the 18th of January and it all looks pretty well between these two.\n\nBlake is also set to perform at Luke Bryan\u2019s Crash My Playa concert series.\n\nThe event takes place at the Riviera Maya in Mexico.\n\nIt seems like these two are having the time of their lives.\n\nHere is Gwen with her kids having a great time.",

The Saturday Night Live star just got two fresh new tattoos, one on his neck, the other on his right thumb, and both appear to be tributes to his new girlfriend.\n\nThe neck tattoo shows a black bunny mask, mirroring the one worn by Grande on the cover of her Dangerous Woman album. The second tattoo, on his thumb, is of her initials, \"AG.\"\n\nPhotos of the tattoos were posted on social media on Saturday by Los Angeles tattoo artist London Reese.\n\n\"We had a good night, somewhere in the hills of Los Angeles,\" Reese wrote on Instagram. \"Pete loves him some Ariana.\"\n\nGrande joins Hillary Clinton in ink form on Davidson's body.

If you watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians or read Kourtney\u2019s blog, you might have noticed just how passionate the reality star is about natural beauty.\n\nAhead, we take a look at some of Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s beauty secrets for natural skin care, including what natural deodorant she uses and how she keeps her skin hydrated with manuka honey.\n\nCoconut oil\n\nSuperfood ingredients such as coconut oil have made their mark on natural skin care and beauty products. And, like many natural beauty devotees, Kourtney is no stranger to its beauty benefits. On top of using the natural oil in her hair, the reality star likes to moisturize her body with it, too. According to her app, Kourtney applies coconut oil to her body skin \u201cright out of the shower\u201d and let it sit for 10 minutes.\n\nIn addition, the reality star uses coconut oil in some homemade beauty recipes, too. One of Kourtney\u2019s go-to\u2019s? A DIY lip scrub made with coconut oil, manuka honey, and sugar. The natural concoction gently sloughs off dry skin and nourishes for a silky soft, smooth, lipstick-ready pout.\n\nManuka honey\n\nAnother all-natural ingredient Kourtney Kardashian swears by for skin care? Manuka honey. The reality star is a big fan of Manuka Doctor skin care products and also swears by the all-natural superfood honey for home skin treatments.\n\nThanks to its natural humectants and anti-aging properties, manuka honey can be used in beauty for many things. For soft, hydrated skin, more youthful-looking skin, apply manuka honey to the complexion as a face mask and let it sit for about 10 minutes before rinsing. You can also add it to homemade beauty product or as a spot treatment on pimples. In addition to being anti-aging and hydrating, manuka honey also boasts anti-bacterial properties that can help combat breakouts and keep the complexion clear.\n\ngood morning A post shared by Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Oct 7, 2017 at 10:57am PDT\n\nNatural deodorant\n\nLike other celebrities and wellness aficionados, Kourtney no longer uses chemical-ridden deodorants and switched to a natural deodorant. \u201cChanging over to an all-natural deodorant seemed like an important thing to do when I heard that when people are diagnosed with breast cancer, they are told to immediately discontinue using conventional antiperspirants and deodorants,\u201d the reality star shared in a blog post. \u201cAlthough research connecting the parabens and aluminum from these products directly with breast cancer is inconclusive, I like to play it safe,\u201d she concluded.\n\nSo, what natural deodorant does Kourtney swear by? Schmidt\u2019s Natural Ylang Ylang + Calendula deodorant. At $8.99 a pop, the natural deodorant is more affordable than other other natural brands. In addition, it features an award-winning formula made with essential oils and free of aluminum, parabens, propylene glycol, and phthalates.\n\nNatural sunscreen\n\nDeodorant isn\u2019t the only natural skin product Kourtney likes to use. As a California native, the reality star knows how crucial it is to protect her skin from the sun. That said, like many of her products, she prefers a more natural formula. Her favorite natural sunscreen? Drunk Elephant Umbra Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!",

The snippet was used to rev the audience during the the pre-game. The \u201cReputation\u201d album has a Nov. 10 release date.\n\nEarlier in the week the first \u201cReputation\u201d single, \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d released Aug. 25, was used to promote the same Florida v.

I mean really fluffy stuff \u2014 puppies learning how to walk, epic marriage proposals, and literally anything to do with babies. Fortunately, I have a celebrity family who truly understands my needs and is here to deliver. I'm talking about Kim Kardashian and Kanye West and their adorable little family, obvi! Every now and then, they take to social media to show us photos or videos of their growing family and, for that, I am eternally grateful. And now, the world is #blessed with a photo of Kanye West kissing Chicago, and it is exactly what I needed to elevate my mood today.\n\nKanye West has definitely been stirring the pot recently with... well, pretty much everything. But the one thing that has always remained constant is how much he clearly adores his children. And on Tuesday, Nov. 13, Kim Kardashian shared the sweetest photo of the \"Lift Yourself\" rapper giving their 9-month-old daughter, Chicago, a kiss on Instagram.\n\nCaptioning it with a simple happy face emoji, the photo shows Kardashian's rapper husband giving Chicago a kiss on the top of her tiny lil' head. Chicago, who's wearing a white tee (perhaps to match her dad) and a grey bib is giving her best \"stare off into the distance\" look, and to say that it's too pure for words is an understatement:\n\nCAN YOU EVEN TAKE THE CUTENESS?\n\nI can't choose which photo is cuter: Chicago and Kanye West having a precious moment together, or the photo that Kim Kardashian posted of her with her three children, North, Saint, and Chicago (or Chi, if you're trying to feel ~in the know~ with things).\n\nJust a few days ago, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star posted the picture to Instagram, showing herself smizing with Chicago on her lap staring directly into the camera like the perfect little model. Saint is sitting (laying?) next to her giving the camera his very best profile, and North is sitting down on Kim's other side, looking like she has better things to be doing than posing for a picture. Kardashian aptly captioned the photo, \"North is always a mood \ud83d\ude02,\" and I've never heard a more accurate statement.\n\nIt was nice to see some sort of update with Kanye West, though, even if it wasn't regarding his new music. In case you missed it, West pushed back his Yandhi album release date once more, after initially delaying the Sept. 29 debut to Nov. 23. If you're looking to find when exactly his new album will be released, you're going to be pretty disappointed. West has yet to confirm when exactly Yandhi will drop, and on Monday, Nov. 12, he took to Twitter to open up to his fans about his new music.\n\nAfter his performance with rapper Kid Cudi at Camp Flog Gnaw, West explained that he's holding off on debuting his new album because it's not quite ready yet.\n\nHe wrote,\n\nIt felt so good being on the stage last night with my brother Cudi. After performing again, I realize the new album I\u2019ve been working on isn\u2019t ready yet. I\u2019ll announce the release date once it\u2019s done. Thank you for understanding\n\nWell, if I can't get new Kanye West music, I will absolutely settle for more Kanye West family photos, so keep 'em coming, Kim!",

Is this her way of shutting down the romance rumors for good?\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks certainly have a loyal fan in Christina El Moussa, who cheered on the team against the Los Angeles Kings with her friend Cassie on April 9. \u201cCelebrating my Bestie/PR extraordinaire at a @anaheimducks / @lakings game,\u201d Christina captioned a photo of the pair. \u201c#shelikeskings #letsgoducks #justtwogirlswholovehockey.\u201d\n\nThat final hashtag certainly seems to be the Flip or Flop stars way of letting her followers know she was just at the game to watch her fave team play, not to support Ducks\u2019 star, Nate Thompson, specifically. After Christina attended a game last month, the rumor mill quickly started running about her rumored relationship with Nate, but at the time, her rep confirmed to HollywoodLife.com that the two are \u201cjust friends.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it seems like Christina and her ex, Tarek El Moussa, are simply longtime Ducks fans, as he also sat in the crowd at a game earlier this month, clearly not feeling any awkwardness about Nate being on the ice.\n\n\u201c[Christina] has been going to Kings game since she was ten years old,\u201d an insider explained to E! News. \u201cShe loves taking [her daughter], too. She\u2019s still happily single and focusing on her kids and herself.\u201d\n\nDespite ending their marriage in 2016, Christina and Tarek have seemingly remained amicable, even continuing to film their hit HGTV series, Flip or Flop together. However, fans of the show have been devastated to hear reports that the show will be ending after its upcoming season. The exes and network have yet to comment on the future of the show.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Christina is just being coy about dating Nate? Or is she really still single?\n\nJavaScript is required to load the comments.",

        "content": "Whatever prompted Warner Bros. to send home the cast of \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d could change reality television \u2014 but not in the ways you might expect.\n\nThe studio said on Sunday that it has halted production on the popular ABC unscripted series in the middle of Season 4 following \u201callegations of misconduct\u201d and that an investigation is underway. It appears to involve questions about whether a sexual encounter occurred between two cast members, and whether one of them was too inebriated to give consent.\n\nMike Johansson, a senior lecturer for the School of Communication at the Rochester Institute of Technology who has closely followed reality shows, believes that viewers will continue to tune into the \u201cBachelor\u201d franchise, even if something terrible occurred.\n\n\u201cIt goes back to the old P.T. Barnum thing \u2014 there\u2019s no such thing as bad publicity, and this will make people want to watch this particular show even more,\u201d he told TheWrap.\n\nJohansson doesn\u2019t expect the series to enact any significant changes or to limit contestants\u2019 access to booze. He said the only potential impact might be that networks make it harder for productions to grind to a halt mid-season.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d like to think that [a change in alcohol access] would happen, but honestly I think the only change that might come out of this is watertight contracts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a litigious society that if there turns out to be a way that people can bail on the show mid-filming, they\u2019ll probably want to zip that up pretty quick because it gets expensive to produce these things and not end up with anything you can put on TV and sell ads around.\u201d\n\nCertainly, there are previous instances of sex leading to scrutiny for the \u201cBachelor\u201d franchise. In her 2014 memoir \u201cI Didn\u2019t Come Here to Make Friends,\u201d \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d Season 16 winner Courtney Robertson wrote that she and Ben Flajnik had sex in the ocean during a date while the show\u2019s cameras were rolling.\n\n\u201cTo answer your question, yes, Ben and I did have sex in the ocean. On-camera,\u201d she wrote. And she added that Flajnik had concerns after the fact: \u201cHe was like, \u2018Well, 50,000 people just saw that.\u2019\u201d\n\nChristopher Ferguson, a professor of psychology at Stetson University who has contributed to Time and Huffington Post, told TheWrap that dating shows carry \u201csome potential for risk to be sure,\u201d particularly when alcohol is involved. He said that \u201ccontestants may be pushed by producers toward actions they wouldn\u2019t normally take.\u201d\n\nJohansson said situations like the one the show faces aren\u2019t often in the public eye, but added: \u201cThings like this probably have happened in the past, and I think people have been talked back off the ledge \u2014 talked out of quitting the show, deciding to cooperate \u2014 by whatever means.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have heard rumors of people being offered extra monetary enticements to stay on shows,\u201d said Johansson. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of people being basically getting reminded that they did sign a contract, and that breach of contract lawsuits can get expensive. There\u2019s all kinds of reasons I\u2019m sure that people have been kept on shows when they\u2019ve decided to think they probably didn\u2019t want to be on it anymore.\u201d\n\nRichard Gerrig, a professor of psychology at Stony Brook University and author of the book \u201cThe Psychology of Survivor,\u201d doesn\u2019t find it likely that the \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d shutdown will make the \u201cBachelor\u201d franchise less popular. He points out that people continue to tune in despite general questions about the level of producer interference within the reality TV genre.\n\n\u201cMy gut sense is that if people are willing to overlook that what they\u2019re watching is not real in the way that it is advertised as real, then this is kind of a funny situation where [the allegation] doesn\u2019t strike me as being a game changer or a deal breaker \u2014 [although] maybe it should be,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Camille Grammer has been diagnosed with cancer again.\n\nThe 49-year-old Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star spoke to PEOPLE exclusively on Thursday after revealing on Instagram she had received a Squamous Cell Carcinoma diagnosis and was recovering from surgery, having \u201cthose pesky cancer cells\u201d removed.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time the former dancer and model has battled cancer. In 2013, she was diagnosed with Stage 2 Endometrial Cancer and underwent a radical hysterectomy. She is currently in remission and has dedicated the past few years to spreading awareness about the below-the-belt cancers as a spokesperson for the Foundation for Women\u2019s Cancer.\n\nLike her Endometrial Cancer, Grammer\u2019s Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) was found below the belt as well.\n\n\u201cCancer really stinks,\u201d Grammer told PEOPLE. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate it runs in my family. I was diagnosed with Lynch Syndrome 15 years ago, so I have a genetic disposition to cancer. My mom had it also and her mom and unfortunately, these cancers seem to come along with the territory.\u201d\n\n\u201cEarly detection is key,\u201d Grammer added, explaining that SCC can show up anywhere from the skin to the lung to your throat. \u201cMany people, if something shows up like this, they\u2019ll ignore it. They\u2019ll think, \u2018Oh it\u2019s a mole, it\u2019s a pimple, it\u2019s a rash, it\u2019s an ingrown hair from shaving.\u2019 \u2026 This isn\u2019t an aggressive cancer, but if it goes undetected, it could spread and metastasize to the lymph nodes and other organs close to the area. I\u2019m lucky we found it early.\u201d\n\nTommy Garcia/Bravo\n\nWhile she admitted the location of her latest scare was \u201ca little embarrassing to talk about,\u201d Grammer made it clear she wanted to \u201clift the vail of shame\u201d from below-the-belt cancers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important for women to go for check-ups,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore these symptoms. We can\u2019t ignore signals that our bodies are giving us when something is wrong. I\u2019m a spokesperson, and advocate of awareness. So when anything comes up on our bodies \u2014 if it\u2019s skin cancer or a bump or something we\u2019re not certain of \u2014 we need to see our doctors. Go in, make an appointment, see our physicians, and don\u2019t ignore these symptoms. When they present, don\u2019t sweep them under the rug like so many of us do.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Tamra Judge Delays Bodybuilding Competition After Discovering More Skin Cancer: \u2018Get Your Skin Checked\u2019\n\nSquamous Cell Carcinoma, or SCC, is the second most common from of skin cancer, the Skin Cancer Foundation reports \u2014 and it is usually caused by cumulative ultraviolet exposure over the course of a lifetime. SCCs often appear as scaly red patches or elevated growths. More than 1 million cases of squamous cell carcinoma are diagnosed each year in the U.S., and (depending on different estimates) as many as 8,800 people die from the disease.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how exactly I got it, but listen \u2014 I used to go to tanning beds. As a teenager, those were so popular,\u201d Grammer said, clarifying that she\u2019ll have to wait about a week for pathology reports to come back to learn whether the SCC falls under the Lynch Syndrome umbrella,. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the cause, I don\u2019t know what the cause is. Some people think it\u2019s from the HPV, but my pap-smear came up negative for HPV. Again, there\u2019s no clear certain reason why this showed up in this case. But it\u2019s better to get checked.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday morning, Grammer shared a photo of herself at Cedars-Sinai hospital smiling next to her \u201camazing\u201d surgeon Dr. Beth Karlan. \u201cMy cancer was removed and I\u2019m resting at home,\u201d she wrote. \u201cLadies listen to your bodies. If something doesn\u2019t seem right go for a checkup. Don\u2019t put it off. Annual check ups are important.\u201d\n\nCamille Grammer\n\nWhile she waits two weeks to heal and resume physical activity, Grammer will have a strong place of support by her side: fianc\u00e9 David C. Meyer \u2014 whom she has been dating for more than a year after meeting him in Malibu, where Meyer lives and works as a lawyer (He popped the question back in October).\n\nTurns out, Meyer too recently had an SCC removed from his temple. \u201cWe were both laughing about this,\u201d Grammer told PEOPLE. \u201cWith sun exposure, be careful. Protect yourself from the sun and get checkups!\u201d\n\nThis will be the second marriage for both. Grammer (n\u00e9e Camille Donatacci) wed Frasier actor Kelsey Grammer in August 1997; their divorce was finalized in February 2011. The Grammers share two children: daughter Mason, 16, and son Jude, 13.\n\nGrammer is also returning to RHOBH on Tuesday as a friend of the Housewives for the season 8 premiere, something she said she\u2019s excited about because she gets to use the platform to help education more women about fighting cancer.\n\n\u201cBeing a spokesperson for cancer awareness has been a passion of mine,\u201d Grammer said. \u201cIt helps me in my recovery but also helps others. I\u2019m very proud to be a part of this movement.\u201d",

        "content": "Jordin Sparks is Married to Model Dana Isaiah\n\nJordin Sparks, wife of Dana Isaiah, is an American Idol Season 6 winner, singer, actress and songwriter. She\u2019s known for several roles in television and movies produced over the past 5 years, as well as being the youngest person to ever win American Idol at the age of 17 and multiple Grammy nominations. Her net worth is estimated to be at or just over $10 million. After noticing paparazzi taking photos of their group, Sparks decided to secretly marry her boyfriend Dana Isaiah during a vacation in Hawaii. After tying the knot in the water with friends close by, and the husband and wife honeymooned the remainder of the trip. Isaiah had a birthday in May and turned 25 and Sparks, who will celebrate her birthday in December, is 27. Although they are both young in age they each have begun and led successful careers in their own rights.\n\nFrom Boyfriend to Secretly Becoming Her Husband\n\nSparks went public on Instagram with her relationship to then-boyfriend Isaiah in June of 2017, and secretly wed the model that same year in July. Sparks kept her relationship with her boyfriend Isaiah out of the public eye due to a very public relationship with her previous boyfriend Jason Derulo proving that the pitfalls of fame wreaked havoc on her then-boyfriend and relationship. She followed that same rational when it came to their status as newlyweds and kept the news of their marriage under wraps until sharing news of their bundle of Joy in the fall.\n\nSparks found out about her pregnancy only a month after she and Isaiah\u2019s impromptu wedding. Because of her understanding of life in the public eye and the scrutiny that comes with it, Sparks waited to announce her pregnancy with the new dad-to-be Isaiah until September of 2017. According to Sparks, Isaiah has wanted to share the good news with everyone but respected his wife\u2019s desire for privacy. Isaiah is thrilled to be expecting his first child with sparks early next spring.\n\nWho exactly is Dana Isaiah?\n\nMany have asked this question since news of their relationship broke earlier this summer and while the two seem to be blissfully in love and over the moon about their child-to-be, there is so much to learn about the model that stole this singer\u2019s heart. One thing is for sure: with a compassionate heart, great body and beautiful face, Sparks won the lottery. We think they are an amazing couple and perfect for each other in every way. Want to learn more about Mr. Isaiah? Check out these 5 things to know about him below!\n\n1. Dana Isaiah is a Christian\n\nOne very special and important thing that attracted Sparks and Isaiah to each other is their shared faith. Isaiah is a Christian and so is Sparks. The two constantly post scriptures and messages conveying their shared faith on their personal Instagram accounts. In fact, lots of their Instagram photos together show Sparks and Isaiah sharing their faith with others! Jordin Sparks recently performed the national anthem during a football game in which she had the bible verse Proverbs 31:8-9 written on the back of her hand.\n\n2. Dana Isaiah is a Model\n\nEven though his wife is very well off, Dana Isaiah has got some money of his own. From modeling clothes to several professional shoots shared on his social media relating to fitness, Isaiah is a model making a name for himself. Isaiah\u2019s net worth is said to be around $100,000 and that\u2019s no small feat. His portfolio boasts features in a variety of publications and fitness campaigns, including a shoot in Lapalme Magazine where he also graced the cover. Isaiah frequently shares images of his modeling gigs on his Instagram account.\n\n3. Dana Isaiah is REALLY into Fitness\n\nIsaiah is a trainer and frequently works out with Sparks. He labels himself as a \u201cfitness enthusiast\u201d who loves to work out with Sparks, calling her his workout partner for life. The two are proof that couples that sweat together stay together! They can be seen together in the gym when Isaiah posts videos of his training sessions when he\u2019s sweating it out with his wife. Being fit and athletic are normal for Isaiah who has been involved in sports and fitness most of his life. Isaiah is both a trainer and fitness model and enjoys exercising for health and fun.\n\n4. Dana Isaiah is huge on family\n\nIsaiah celebrated his 25th birthday by working out and with FaceTime conversations with his family.

John Legend and Kanye West set their recent Twitter drama behind them as they took a photo and danced together at Chrissy Teigen's baby shower\n\nIt certainly seemed as if John was a fan of the song, as the pair bobbed their heads while listening alongside fellow party guests.\n\nKanye also posted a video of the Ordinary People singer playing the piano.\n\n'Lead with love,' Kanye captioned the video.\n\nThe pair seem to have put the bizarre Twitter drama behind them as they enjoyed time with their loved ones.\n\nNew hit! It certainly seemed as if John was a fan of the song, as the pair bobbed their heads while listening alongside fellow party guests\n\nOn Thursday, Kanye took to Twitter to post his text messages with John, and accused the singer of 'manipulating my free thought.'\n\nIn the text messages, John urged Kanye to reconsider aligning himself with President Donald Trump, after the rapper showed his support for the politician during his lengthy Twitter tirade on Wednesday, even posting an autographed MAGA hat online.\n\nDonald was clearly a fan of Kanye's message, re-tweeting him and adding, 'Thank you Kanye, very cool!'\n\nParty time: Jesse Tyler Ferguson was among the guests to celebrate Teigen's baby boy\n\n'You're way too powerful and influential to endorse who he is and what he stands for,' John, who has been vocal about his distaste for the 45th president, wrote in his text message. 'As you know, what you say really means something to your fans.\n\n'They are loyal to you and respect your opinion. So many people who love you feel so betrayed right now because they know the harm that Trump's policies cause, especially to people of color. Don't let this be part of your legacy. You're the greatest artist of our generation.'\n\nKanye replied, 'I love you John and I appreciate your thoughts. You bringing up my fans or my legacy is a tactic based on fear used to manipulate my free thought.'\n\nPiano man: West shared a video of Legend playing the piano, which he captioned, 'Lead with love'\n\nIt did not end there as Kanye posted the continuation of their conversation as John urged him to: 'Think freely. Think with empathy and context too. Your words and actions have consequences. Much love.'\n\nJohn even poked fun at Kanye for posting their private messages on the popular micro-blogging site as he took the opportunity to plug his latest track called A Good Night.\n\nThe talented crooner wrote: 'And since you're posting texts, let me add that I have a new single out haha'.\n\nNo time for drama: The pair seem to have put the bizarre Twitter drama behind them as they enjoyed time with their loved ones\n\nKanye explained why he made the decision to post their text thread to show that there was a contentious but respectful discourse between the two of them.\n\nHe said: 'I tweeted the John text to show that there are people around me that disagree with me and voice their opinion. I respect everyone's opinion but I stand my ground.'\n\nKanye, who also said in his Twitter rant that he was a fan of Hillary Clinton, went on to explain that he wanted to show people that he was empathetic as empathy isn't the first thing people think when it comes to a Trump supporter.\n\nKanye wrote: 'I really appreciate this dialogue with John Legend because I'm actually very empathetic. Im still the kid from the telethon. I feel when people think of MAGA they don't think of empathy.'",

Netflix released the first 10 episodes of season 3, and Masterson\u2019s Rooster made his final appearance in the tenth episode, entitled \u201cChange.\u201d\n\nRelated: Hollywood\u2019s Sexual Misconduct Scandals While Hollywood may appear to be all glitz and glam on the surface, the industry has seen its fair share of scandals through the years. The New York Times and the New Yorker first published investigative pieces in 2017 that accused disgruntled movie producer Harvey Weinstein of decades of sexual assault and harassment. Soon after, Weinstein stood trial and was [\u2026]\n\nIn the beginning of the episode, Rooster gets into an argument with Mary\u2019s (Megyn Price) boyfriend Nick and Nick threatens to kill Rooster. However, it\u2019s broken up by Ashton Kutcher\u2019s Colt. Rooster tells Heather (Kelli Goss) about Nick, who then relays the message to Mary \u2013 and Mary breaks up with Nick. So, Rooster invites Mary to WrestleMania only to come home and see that Nick has, once again, broken into his place. Nick gives Rooster a duffle bag full of his things and says, \u201cYou either take that bag and disappear, or you could just disappear.\u201d He then pulls out a gun and threatens to kill Rooster\u2019s entire family. So, he leaves.\n\nIt was an exit that audiences knew was coming. \u201cAs a result of ongoing discussions, Netflix and the producers have written Danny Masterson out of The Ranch,\u201d Netflix told Us Weekly in a statement in December. \u201cProduction will resume in early 2018 without him.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department has been investigating Masterson since March when four women came forward claiming they had been raped by the actor in the early 2000s. Following his firing, Masterson again denied all allegations made against him.\n\nRelated: Stars Who Were Fired From Jobs From fast food to newspaper delivery, find out what gigs the stars loathed\n\n\u201cI am obviously very disappointed in Netflix\u2019s decision to write my character off of The Ranch. From day one, I have denied the outrageous allegations against me. Law enforcement investigated these claims more than 15 years ago and determined them to be without merit,\u201d Masterson said in a statement to Us at the time. \u201cI have never been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one. In this country, you are presumed innocent until proven guilty.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cHowever, in the current climate, it seems as if you are presumed guilty the moment you are accused. I understand and look forward to clearing my name once and for all. In the meantime, I want to express my gratitude to the cast and crew that I\u2019ve worked so closely with over the past three seasons. I wish them nothing but success. I am also so thankful to the fans that have supported me and continue to do so.\u201d\n\nThe Ranch is now streaming on Netflix.",

The image in question, which shows the \u201cSorry Not Sorry\u201d singer out on the town with old Disney Channel friends, first surfaced on a fan Instagram account for the pop star Hayley Kiyoko.\n\nIn a comment first noticed by Buzzfeed, one follower called out the glass that Lovato holds in her right hand. The glass was apparently shaded out when the photo was shared by her other friends who accompanied her in the picture.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not tryna question Demi\u2019s sobriety bc I have a lot of respect for her,\u201d the commenter says in part. \u201cIt just seems weird that her best friends post this pic with it shaded and then Hayley who isn\u2019t rlly that close to Demi posts the one where you can see what she\u2019s holding?? Like tf is going on.\u201d\n\nLovato noticed the comment and posted one of her own, making it clear that she resented that implication that she had broken her sobriety. \u201cI don\u2019t have to defend anything but it was Red Bull,\u201d she fired back.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest from PEOPLE?

It IS possible. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\u201d\n\nThe news came months after the release of her acclaimed documentary Simply Complicated, in which she chronicled the daily struggles she experiences with her recovery. The candid film even began with Lovato admitting she was using cocaine for the majority of filming for her 2012 documentary Stay Strong.\n\n\u201cI was so honest in that documentary but I wasn\u2019t honest enough. And I think it was because I wasn\u2019t honest with myself,\u201d Lovato told PEOPLE in October. \u201cYes, I did touch on issues and certain things that were real and true but I think the biggest problem was I was lying to myself. And in this documentary, I\u2019m 1000 percent sober and I get to really explain myself and apologize to my fans. There wasn\u2019t anything that was off-limits.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I definitely feel relief from,\u201d she added. \u201cBeing so honest and open and talking about subjects that I never talked about before is a big part of why I feel relieved \u2026 I feel like I got to really speak my truth.\u201d",

News and blasted her co-stars; telling the outlet that if she had her way half the current cast would get the ax.\n\n\u201cHoney, I don\u2019t have an executive seat at Bravo, but if I did, half of this cast would be gone,\u201d NeNe admitted. \u201cTrust me. I would not have them here working.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, NeNe is also advocating for her BFF Marlo Hampton to get a peach and become a full-time cast member in the future. Marlo has been part of RHOA since season 4 and has always brought the drama but remains only a friend of the Housewives to this day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said I think she deserves a peach. Now, I don\u2019t think the whole cast was supportive of her having a peach until me and her fell out. When we fell out, then they were all the way here for her having a peach and taking pictures with her and hanging out with her. Then when we got back cool again, now they\u2019re all like all over the place,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, listen, Marlo\u2019s super funny, she\u2019s a great addition to the show. I don\u2019t care if she has a peach if she stays a friend of the show, she\u2019s being seen a lot. I think she\u2019s OK. But I thought she deserved it.\u201d\n\nNeNe claims that some of the friends on RHOA are bringing it more than certain full-time Housewives but aren\u2019t reaping the benefits of a full-time paycheck.\n\n\u201cThe reason why is there are people being paid on this show who need to be a friend to the show. And they need to spread that check around to somebody who\u2019s really bringing something to the show,\u201d she said. \u201cThese folks getting these big checks who really don\u2019t need them, I would spread them around to some of the friends on the show who bring the drama. Or demote some of these people to friends. You know who I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\nSo, which co-stars does NeNe want to go? She\u2019s not telling \u2013 yet.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of girls I would not give a peach back to, but the moment I start naming them is the moment I have an argument with everybody on the cast because they swear that you are trying to stop them from eating,\u201d NeNe wrapped. \u201cNo honey, you\u2019re stopping yourself when you\u2019re boring.\u201d\n\nI have to agree with NeNe cuts need to be made on RHOA or the ladies need to step up their game big time. Some of the ATL Housewives are so dull this season! I think Kenya and Porsha and even maybe Sheree need to go. Buh-Bye!\n\nThoughts on NeNe\u2019s interview? Which of her co-stars do you think NeNe wants to see gone? Should Bravo make Marlo a full-time Housewife? Are some of the full-time Housewives slacking this season?

        "content": "Updated Dec. 18, 2017, 8:00 a.m. PT: We can finally put the kibosh on any kind of rumor that Big Little Lies costars Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern are feuding. Why can we do that, you ask? Well, as it happens, both Witherspoon and Dern connected on Twitter recently to brainstorm some adorable and unconventional Big Little Lies Season 2 ideas \u2014 and we\u2019re living for it.\n\nOn Dec. 14, Dern posted a video from her Star Wars: The Last Jedi promotional duties where she has a cute moment with the most twee droid of them all, BB-8. Witherspoon, not missing a beat, tweeted at her, \u201cI love him! Can BB8 be in BLL2?\u201d\n\nI love him ! Can BB8 be in BLL2? \u2014 Reese Witherspoon (@RWitherspoon) December 14, 2017\n\nOf course, Dern saw an easy way to bring the worlds of Star Wars and Big Little Lies together, and she didn\u2019t hesitate to pitch her idea to Witherspoon right away. \u201cUm\u2026yes. Easy. Renata just bought the real BB-8 for Christmas for her daughter. Knowing u would likely get your daughter the toy!\u201d.\n\nUm\u2026yes. Easy. Renata just bought the real BB-8 for Christmas for her daughter. Knowing u would likely get your daughter the toy! \u2014 Laura Dern (@LauraDern) December 14, 2017\n\nOK, this idea is actually amazing and yes, now I will need Amabella to get a BB-8 in Big Little Lies Season 2 or else all will be for naught.\n\nOriginal story, published Sept. 18, 2017: The internet seems to think that something is brewing between Big Little Lies stars Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern, and it\u2019s not at all friendly. This is, of course, speculative and incredibly problematic to say the least, if only because the speculation is looking to pit two women against one another for no good reason. Because Dern didn\u2019t embrace Witherspoon and suddenly that\u2019s a sign of a feud? It sounds fishy, folks.\n\nSpeculation began brewing on Sunday night at the 69th Primetime Emmys when Dern skipped over Witherspoon as she received congratulations after winning Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie. When Dern was announced as the winner, a curious thing happened: She passed right over Witherspoon.\n\nMore: Is Big Little Lies Season 2 Actually a Good Idea?\n\nIt\u2019s traditional during an awards show, especially one like the Emmys or Oscars where big groups related to a project show up, that the winner might take a moment to get hugs and kisses from their dates or co-stars before going up onstage. Considering the established narrative of how close the women of Big Little Lies are in real life, to see Dern get announced as the winner and move right over Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman (seated in front of Witherspoon) is interesting and noteworthy, but it\u2019s not exactly damning proof that Dern loathes Witherspoon, is it?\n\nWhat did Reese Witherspoon do to Laura Dern?! #EMMY2017 pic.twitter.com/0a013ucBQ8 \u2014 Adam B. Vary (@adambvary) September 18, 2017\n\nMore: Big Little Lies Almost Didn\u2019t Get Made, Because Sexism\n\nThere are a few reasons right off the bat that there\u2019s no smoke, no fire and lots of unnecessary internet chatter about this. First off, Dern\u2019s nerves may have gotten the best of her. There\u2019s a chance she just kind of quickly hugged the first people she saw before making her way to the stage so she could give her proper thanks. Second of all, there\u2019s a chance that maybe Dern and Witherspoon are cool but perhaps they just don\u2019t show their affection for one another in that way. There\u2019s also reason to believe that the cameras focused on Dern after Witherspoon acknowledge her and congratulated her.\n\nMore: One Big Little Lies Star Might Run for Congress\n\nListen, at the end of the day, there\u2019s most likely nothing here; the internet is talking about a problem that simply isn\u2019t there. There\u2019s no need to blow something entirely out of proportion \u2014 however interesting or somewhat shady it may be \u2014 when it could risk painting two women whom we otherwise love and who have not been prone to catty behavior in public before this with a broad brush.",

Perhaps the only thing that would make both shows better is if they joined forces \u2014 and because Netflix is Netflix, the streaming site offered us the crossover episode we never even knew we needed.\n\nYep, a Queer Eye and Nailed It! crossover episode exists, released with the second season of the latter, and I don\u2019t know about you, but it\u2019s the most ambitious crossover event in HISTORY. (No offense, Infinity War.)\n\nCan you believe?!\n\nIn the episode, our BFFs Antoni Porowski, Jonathan Van Ness, Tan France, Bobby Berk, and Karamo Brown visit the Nailed It! kitchen for a fabulous baking challenge. The guys, with the exception of Antoni (as he is tasked by host Nicole Byer and chocolatier Jacques Torres to be the guest judge) try to recreate fondant versions of themselves, and well\u2026let\u2019s just say that they\u2019re better off revamping houses and putting together outfits.\n\n\u201cThe kitchen is my sunken place,\u201d culture expert Karamo says at one point, to which Byer responded, \u201cDon\u2019t be a black man giving up in front of America!\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t want to spoil anything, so we won\u2019t tell you who wins, but we\u2019ll tell you this: It is NOT Jonathan, because his finished cupcake of Tan is a complete MESS.\n\nImage zoom\n\nI\u2019m sorry, henny, but that does not resemble a cupcake AT ALL.\n\nTrust us when we say that the Queer Eye x Nailed It! crossover event is the best 12 minutes you\u2019ll watch today.

        "content": "Depending on how you look at it, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are the most famous members of their family. Some favor Kim over Kylie and vice versa, but one thing Jenner has surpassed Kardashian in is her net worth. On July 11, Forbes revealed its new cover for the \"America's Women Billionaires\" issue, and Jenner is front and center. The outlet reports that thanks to Kylie Cosmetics, the new mom is almost a billionaire. People on Twitter started pitting the sisters against each other over their money, but Kim Kardashian's tweet about Kylie Jenner's Forbes cover shows that she's the farthest from jealous someone could get: she's proud.\n\nWhen the Forbes cover was released on July 11, Jenner posted the cover to her Instagram in a moment of pride. She said, \"wow. i can\u2019t believe I\u2019m posting my very own @forbes cover. thank you for this article and the recognition. I\u2019m so blessed to do what i love everyday. i couldn\u2019t have dreamt this up! #KylieCosmetics.\" The article finely outlines Jenner's net worth as a result of Kylie Cosmetics, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, her and Kendall Jenner's PacSun clothing line, and her other various money-making schemes, and she's worth $900 million. Kim Kardashian, on the other hand, is worth $350 million, according to Forbes.\n\nIt's not like either of those numbers are small or unimpressive, but nevertheless, people on Twitter started trolling Kardashian and Jenner, many joking that Kardashian must be extremely jealous that her youngest sister ended up more successful than her (money wise).\n\nThis is Kylie Jenner's Forbes cover.\n\nAnd here's what Twitter had to say about it.\n\nLots of people (including Dictionary.com) are arguing that Jenner isn't self-made at all. I mean... I feel like it's obvious that she's objectively not. She was born into a famous family, was on KUWTK because it was about said famous family. Jenner has 100 percent taken the fame she already had and used it to her advantage better than any of her siblings, but self-made? Nah.\n\nDictionary.com trolled Jenner in the most savage way when this cover came out.\n\nThe account quoted Forbes tweet of Jenner's cover and said, \"Self-made means having succeeded in life unaided. Used in a sentence: Forbes says that Kylie Jenner is a self-made woman.\" The (pretty true) shade! Jenner is a hard worker, no doubt, and the success of Kylie Cosmetics is thanks to her, but the literal definition of \"self-made\" consists of not having any help. You can't really be self-made when you're born into fame and then you use that fame to your favor. More power to Jenner for creating one of the most successful makeup companies in the world, but that success is in part thanks to the fact that she was born with more privilege than most.\n\nOne person who has no issue with Jenner's success, however, is Kim Kardashian.\n\nKardashian tweeted Jenner's Forbes cover not once, but twice. Her first tweet said, \"CONGRATS @KylieJenner\" with three flame emojis. The second said \"Wait I'm posting this again just because!!!! BILLION DOLLAR BABY\" with a bunch of emojis. Kim K has no time for people saying she's jealous. (She also posted a video on her Instagram story in honor of Jenner.)\n\nOne fan came to the family's defense about their work ethic and the doubt about their success.\n\nThe tweet said, \"The Kardashian Jenner women are the smartest, hardest working women that I know. They are the first to start their work day before the sun rises and always the last ones to end it. Debate and hate all you want but their success and longevity is no accident.\" Kardashian quoted the tweet with three clapping emojis.\n\nWhether you think Kylie Jenner is \"self-made\" or not, one person we can thank for all of this is Kris Jenner. Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and the Devil may work hard, but Kris Jenner works harder.",

The National Enquirer reported that Mandel wants to receive an invite to the \"Suits\" star's wedding.\n\n\"It would be nice if Meghan invited him,\" an unnamed source said. \"Howie gave her career a big boost, and he's very proud of all the young ladies from the show. He's been reminding everyone who will listen that he found her first.\"\n\nGossip Cop debunked the previous report. The publication reached out to Mandel's rep who denied the rumors. The \"America's Got Talent\" judge's rep said that the report claiming that Mandel wants an invitation to the royal wedding is \"made-up.\"\n\nThe publication added that there are a lot of popular celebrities that also appeared in \"Deal or No Deal,\" including Chrissy Teigen. Mandel never clamored for an invitation to her wedding with John Legend. Also, the show aired for four years and it involved dozens of briefcase girls. Thus, it is unlikely for Mandel to expect invites from all of the ladies' weddings.\n\nIn related news, Markle's \"Deal or No Deal\" photos has resurfaced online. Earlier this month, a snap of Markle wearing a sexy Santa outfit made headlines. In the snap are Markle, Mandel and her fellow case models.\n\nThe photo was taken during the 35th episode of \"Deal or No Deal\" Season 2. It aired on Christmas Day in 2006.\n\nMarkle confessed that her appearance in the show was \"to make ends meet.\" She was still an auditioning actress at that time and was still waiting for a big break.\n\n\"I would put that in the category of things I was doing while I was auditioning to try to make ends meet,\" Markle said. \"I would end up standing up there forever in these terribly uncomfortable and inexpensive five-inch heels just waiting for someone to pick my number so I could go and sit down.\"\n\nWhile Mandel's invite remains unconfirmed, Markle's parents are expected to be part of her royal wedding. The \"Remember Me\" star reportedly wanted to get her dad, Tom Markle, and mom, Doria Radlan, to be involved in her big day. In fact, Markle wanted to stick with traditions and have her dad walk her down the aisle.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images/Chris Jackson",

A more conservative estimate earlier this week from the disaster research group Enki Research put the total at $30 billion.\n\nDamage to Puerto Rico has been catastrophic. People are scrambling for food, water, fuel and cash. Almost the entire island is without power, and outages are expected to last for months in some areas.\n\nRelated: Who will help Puerto Rico?\n\nThe Moody's estimate says as much as $40 billion could be lost in economic output because of impassable roads and lost power. Property damage could total $55 billion.\n\nFor comparison: Moody's estimates that Hurricanes Irma and Harvey combined caused more than $150 billion in damage after those storms hit major U.S. cities in Texas, Florida and Georgia.\n\n\"Given that Harvey and Irma disrupted far larger and more vibrant economies than that of Puerto Rico, this reflects the stunning amount of damage that Maria has wrought,\" Kamins said.\n\nRelated: The people of Puerto Rico are in a desperate scramble for cash\n\nPuerto Rico's economy was already struggling. The island has been in recession for 11 years and has lost 10% of its population in that time. In May, it filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.\n\nKamins said fallout from Hurricane Maria could make it all worse. Puerto Ricans are American citizens and can freely move to the mainland.\n\n\"The end result could be a permanent increase in the rate of population decline, with many of those who remain too poor to move elsewhere,\" he said. \"Puerto Rico's already murky future is now even more in doubt.\"\n\nThe catastrophe modeling firm RMS released a damage estimate Thursday for the entire Caribbean that was also more conservative than Moody's. It said damage to the region could be $30 billion to $60 billion.\n\nMaria devastated several islands in the region, including Dominica and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",

The dream team of Body By Simone personal trainer Simone De La Rue and nutritionist Kelly LeVeque \u2014 whose client list includes the likes of Jennifer Garner, Emmy Rossum, Jessica Alba and Molly Sims \u2014 have just released an app that gives users access to their expertise for a very nominal monthly fee.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just an app stuffed with content \u2014 more than 900 minutes of video and hundreds of recipes \u2014 that leaves users to their own devices to navigate and motivate. For $19.99/month, the platform actually uses artificial intelligence software to create customized workout plans and nutrition programs for each individual, taking into consideration their specific goals. It tracks progress via measurements and weekly photos, and reminds users via push notifications to work out. \u201cIt is programmed to provide the customization of a personal workout with me,\u201d says De La Rue, adding, \u201cThis has never been done before in a fitness app.\u201d\n\nBut while it may seem the app approach speaks only to the general population, De La Rue says hers and LeVeque\u2019s celebrity clients are \u201cvery excited, especially as they are often on set or traveling. They can have their dream team in their pocket.\u201d The impetus for the app was a desire to have a platform available to anyone in the world, since the Aussie trainer on E\u2019s Revenge Body can\u2019t be everywhere at once. For a more 360-degree approach, she wanted to include a nutritionist, and because of their several shared clients (Garner and Rossum among them) and complementary beliefs and philosophies, LeVeque was the ideal fit.\n\nWhen it comes to nutrition, protein and plants are at the core. Recipes run the gamut and might include Jen Garner\u2019s Chocolate Blueberry #fab4smoothie, with collagen, almond butter, spinach, flax and other nutritious ingredients. Says LeVeque of their approach: \u201cProtein ups collagen, muscle tone and metabolism. Fat benefits hormones, skin and cellular health and does not store as fat as simple carbs do. Fiber for gut microbiome proliferation and detoxification, and greens or veggies deep in color to fight inflammation.\u201d These \u201cfab four\u201d foods are at the core of her recipes.\n\nThe workouts mix up methodology to keep things interesting, and never use props so they can be done literally anywhere. De La Rue\u2019s favorite currently: dance cardio. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible workout, burns calories, teaches you coordination, challenges your brain to learn choreography and it\u2019s fun and joyous,\u201d she says. The pair\u2019s one-stop-shop app also doles out motivational words and advice, since that\u2019s key to many people\u2019s success with a new wellness plan.\n\nLeVeque suggests users get up and exercise first thing in the morning, since a fasted workout has the same benefits as intermittent fasting, which causes a surge in human growth hormone and testosterone to help burn fat. Additionally, she advocates for early dinners, before dark \u2014 which seems decidedly un-Hollywood but has very Hollywood ramifications. \u201cAn early dinner allows for the body to digest the meal, balance blood sugar and clear excess insulin before you head to bed,\u201d says LeVeque, \u201cso you can benefit from a fat-burning, belt-shrinking night of sleep!\u201d We see why Garner and Rossum swear by these ladies.",

As we detail at the very bottom of this article, Lilly listed this home for sale three years later, in November 2023, for $17.2 million.\n\nLilly Lashes\n\nIn addition to her line of swimgerie, Lilly is the creator of a highly successful line of eyelashes called \"Lilly Lashes\". Today the brand reportedly generates $15 million per year in revenue.\n\nEarly Life and Reality Career\n\nShe was born in Houston, Texas in April 1983. Her real name is Neelufar Seyed Ghalichi. While Lilly Ghalichi may look like a \"Persian Barbie\" with her long skinny legs and skimpy outfits, she is much more than meets the eye. In addition to being a knock out, Ghalichi is also an attorney, fashion designer, and blogger. Ghalichi is originally from Houston but moved to Los Angeles after passing the bar exam. Instead of pursuing a legal career, Ghalichi knew that her passions were in the fashion world.\n\nLilly was introduced to the world of Shahs of Sunset as one of cast member Reza Farahan's real estate clients. Outside of the world of reality television, Lilly Ghalichi has launched a line of racy bikinis that is inspired by lingerie called \"Have Faith Swimgerie\". Lilly Ghalihchi has also appeared in episodes of the TV series Good Day L.A., Big Morning Buzz Live, Bethenny, The Shahs Come Clean with Nadine, and Dr. Mona Vand: The Modern Pharmacist.\n\nLilly earned her Bachelor's degree from Red McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin then went to Loyola Law School in Los Angeles where she graduated Cum Laude with honors.\n\nPersonal Life and Real Estate\n\nLilly married Dara Mir in May 2017 at the Beverly Hills Hotel. They split up in the summer of 2019 but ultimately reconciled. Dara Mir is a successful entrepreneur in his own right. He is the President of ergonomic furniture company 9 to 5 seating.\n\nIn April 2020 Lilly and Dara paid $19.5 million for an 11,000 square-foot home down the street from the Bel-Air Country Club and the Hotel Bel-Air. They bought the home from the estate of automotive icon Lee Iococca. Lee paid $4.25 million for the home back in 1993, the same as $7.6 million in today's dollars. Lee arranged to have access to the exclusive hotel from his property through a side gate, allowing him to walk to and from as he pleased, a convenience Lilly and Dara will now have. Iococca's heirs originally listed the home for $26 million. In November 2020 Lilly deeded the rights to this home over to Dara, potentially a sign that the couple was again planning to separate.\n\nIn 2012 Dara paid $6.1 million for a hillside home in Bel Air, not far from the previously-mentioned new home. He demolished the home that was on the property and built a large multi-structure compound in its place. His next door neighbor at this property is Elon Musk. Though Musk owns several homes on this block.\n\nIn December 2020 it was revealed that Lilly paid $14 million for Kathy Griffin's Bel Air mansion. Kathy had been seeking $16 million.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been long enough to discover pet peeves with each other,\u201d Hyland told PEOPLE recently about their romance. \u201cI think we\u2019re in the honeymoon phase of living together.

        "content": "Tituss Burgess delivered one of ET's Standout Performances of the 2017-18 season.\n\nFor four seasons (and a possible movie), Tituss Burgess has embodied Titus Andromedon, the unapologetically loud and proud roommate to Kimmy Schmidt (Ellie Kemper) on Netflix\u2019s Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He\u2019s flamboyant. He\u2019s verbose. He\u2019s nothing short of snarky. He\u2019s a struggling actor -- rather, an \u201cundercover superstar\u201d -- who has a tendency to get in the way of his own success. He emotes through Beyonce, hiding nothing from his friend Kimmy, landlord Lillian (Carol Kane), agent Jacqueline White (Jane Krakowski) or ex-lover Mikey (Mike Carlsen).\n\n\u201cPlaying him is exhausting,\u201d Burgess tells ET by phone. It\u2019s the day of the Royal Wedding, but the actor is as far removed from the day\u2019s festivities -- he\u2019s traveling to Washington, D.C., where he\u2019s set to perform at the 2018 WNO Opera Gala Concert the next day -- as he is from his onscreen persona. \u201cI don't live in that space. My energy hovers around a two or three on a scale of one to 10.\u201d That\u2019s not to say the actor hasn\u2019t enjoyed playing the character -- in fact, it\u2019s been a career-making moment -- but when it\u2019s 5 a.m. on set and he has to deliver all of Titus\u2019 eccentricities, \u201cit takes a toll.\u201d\n\nBurgess recalls being on set the day before with Kemper as the two filmed scenes from the show\u2019s final episodes when it dawned on both of them that this journey was coming to an end. \u201cShe and I looked at each other and realized how blessed we were and what an unusual experience we got to have and what an unusual show we got to do,\u201d he says of the series that has been anything but typical.\n\nTelling the story of a young woman who moves to New York City after being forced to live in an underground bunker for the past 15 years, the incredibly quirky series co-created by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock was slated for a 13-episode run on NBC before unexpectedly being sold to Netflix, which picked it up for an initial two seasons. Kimmy Schmidt became the streaming network\u2019s first original half-hour comedy and was met with critical acclaim, as well as 16 Primetime Emmy nominations in its first three seasons. Now, the show is drawing to a close with a final fourth season that's broken up into two parts -- the second half of season four premieres Jan. 25, 2019 -- and a reported movie. (While Burgess confirms that a movie has been proposed, Netflix has yet to make an official announcement or respond to requests for comment about it.)\n\n\u201cI think Kimmy began to sync up with Ellie and both of them began to have the same experience of gratitude, zooming out and being able to see the larger picture. I think the same happened with Titus and myself,\u201d Burgess recalls. (The plot of the final episodes, he teases, mirrors both the real-life and onscreen journeys for Kemper and Burgess.)\n\nThe gratitude also extends not only to the Emmys, which has nominated Burgess for three consecutive Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series awards, but to the streaming platform, which has introduced the actor (and character) to an international audience. \u201cNothing will match this experience because it put me on the map,\u201d he says.\n\nTituss Burgess in a scene from 'Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.' - Netflix\n\nAs to why Titus has continuously resonated with voters and viewers alike, he says it\u2019s because of how unique the character is. \u201cI didn\u2019t have that type of representation when I was growing up,\u201d Burgess says. \u201cBy the sheer fact that he was new made for something to latch onto. It represented how the landscape in television was and is changing.\u201d There\u2019s also a vicarious experience audiences get by watching someone who is as unfiltered as Titus is, the actor muses, adding that if the show debuted today, he might not have had the same impact. \u201cTitus wouldn\u2019t pop as much under this current administration. People would see it as one of the many unfiltered, loud voices we hear today. Four years ago, believe it or not, was a far more civilized time. Titus up against that backdrop had more of an impression on people.\u201d\n\nWith the show wrapping production, Burgess is now in a unique position in his career where he says he\u2019ll literally be able to create opportunities for himself -- \u201cwhat it will look like and what I want it to be.\u201d He\u2019s not as worried about what comes next or distancing himself from Titus as he is about tapping into new personalities. \u201cThere are many people and many spirits I know and I\u2019m able to download, and the world only saw one of those,\u201d Burgess says. \u201cI\u2019m excited to display other parts of my schizophrenia.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s working on a new album. He has several upcoming film roles, including one as a creepy elevator operator in Netflix\u2019s Set It Up. The others, he says, haven\u2019t been announced, but he \u201cwas shocked\u201d when he got one of them. There\u2019s the musical adaptation of The Preacher\u2019s Wife, which he hopes to bring to Broadway, and which held a reading in December featuring Loretta Devine. \u201cThat is shaping up very nicely,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI will miss it dearly,\u201d Burgess says of playing Titus, acknowledging that \u201cit's going to feel strange not waking up and putting on those clothes, but my whole world will be just as colorful as the one I just played.\u201d\n\nMORE STANDOUT PERFORMANCES OF THE SEASON:",

Jost has been a staff writer for the NBC sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live since 2005, and co-anchor of Weekend Update since 2014. He also served as one of the show's co-head writers from 2012 to 2015 and later came back as one of the show's head writers in 2017 until 2022 alongside Michael Che.[3][4][5][6][7]\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nColin Jost was born and raised in New York City in the Grymes Hill[8] neighborhood of Staten Island, the elder of two sons.[9][10][11] His mother, Kerry J. Kelly, was the chief medical officer for the New York City Fire Department,[12] and his father, Daniel A. Jost, is a former teacher at Staten Island Technical High School.[13][14] He has one younger brother, Casey Jost, a writer and a producer of Impractical Jokers; he also had a role in Staten Island Summer.[15][16]\n\nRaised Roman Catholic, he attended Regis High School in Manhattan, where he was the editor of the school newspaper The Owl.[15] He attended Harvard University,[9] majoring in history and literature, with a focus on Russian literature and British literature, and wrote his senior thesis on Vladimir Nabokov. Jost graduated cum laude from Harvard in 2004.\n\nWhile at Harvard, he was president of the Harvard Lampoon.[10][17] He also won $5,250 on a college edition of Weakest Link, but said he did not think he deserved to win.[18]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nAfter graduation, Jost worked as a reporter and copy editor for the Staten Island Advance. He was then hired as a writer for a short-lived Nickelodeon animated show, Kappa Mikey. After he left that job, he sent in a writing packet to NBC's Saturday Night Live, which gave him a writing position in 2005.[9]\n\nFrom 2009 to 2012, Jost was SNL's writing supervisor. He was co-head writer from 2012 to 2015, and regained that status from 2017 to 2022.[19][7] He often collaborated with fellow SNL co-head writer Rob Klein.[20] During the summer hiatus following the 2012\u20132013 season, executive producer Lorne Michaels asked Jost if he could do the Weekend Update feature[9] because co-anchor Seth Meyers would soon be leaving to host Late Night with Seth Meyers. Jost accepted and replaced Meyers on the March 1, 2014, episode.[21] Jost later broke Meyers' record for being the longest anchor in the history of the segment on the October 23, 2021, episode hosted by Jason Sudeikis.[22]\n\nJost names Norm Macdonald as a primary influence for his Update anchor work. Macdonald's tone was the one Jost grew up with in high school. He also names Tina Fey as an influence.[9] In addition to Weekend Update, Jost made a brief cameo appearance as Ohio Governor John Kasich in a Republican presidential debate sketch.[23] He later portrayed his friend Pete Buttigieg during the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries[24][25] and Roger Goodell during the 2021 NFL season.[26]\n\nJost has worked in multiple roles related to comedy. He has performed as a stand-up comedian, appearing on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, TBS, and HBO.[27] He was selected as a \"New Face\" at the Montr\u00e9al Just for Laughs festival in 2009,[28] and has since appeared at the Chicago Just for Laughs festival in 2011 and 2012 and the Montr\u00e9al festival again in 2010 and 2012. Jost has published four \"Shouts and Murmurs\" pieces in The New Yorker magazine and has also contributed to The New York Times Magazine, The Huffington Post, The Staten Island Advance and Radar.[29] He wrote the screenplay of and played a minor role in the 2015 comedy film Staten Island Summer, and he also had a minor role as Paul in the 2016 romcom feature How to Be Single.[30] In January 2016, Jost opened for comedian Liam McEneaney's album recording at The Bell House in Brooklyn.[31] In late 2018, Jost and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers appeared in an advertising campaign for Izod.[32]\n\nJost, along with Michael Che, appeared on the March 4, 2019, episode of WWE's Monday Night Raw, where both were announced as special correspondents for WrestleMania 35. In the March 4 episode, they got involved in a storyline with wrestler Braun Strowman, which resulted in both Jost and Che becoming participants in the Andr\u00e9 the Giant Memorial Battle Royal at WrestleMania.[33][34] At the event, Jost and Che went under the ring for the majority of the match and then tried to eliminate Strowman while he was trying to do the same to the Hardy Boyz. Jost attempted to calm the situation by using his therapist, but Strowman chokeslammed him and eliminated the two comedians in quick succession, winning the battle royal.[35]\n\nIn July 2020, Jost released a memoir entitled A Very Punchable Face: A Memoir.[36] The book was well received and appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List.[37]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nJost and Scarlett Johansson in 2023\n\nJost was dormmates with 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg while the two lived in Leverett House at Harvard.[38] In 2015, Jost donated money to Buttigieg's mayoral reelection campaign.[39][40] Subsequently, during Buttigieg's presidential campaign, Jost portrayed Buttigieg in the 45th season of SNL.[38][41]\n\nJost is married to actress Scarlett Johansson, whom he met during one of her many occasions hosting SNL.[42] They began a relationship in May 2017[43] and in May 2019 the two were engaged.[44] They married in October 2020, at their New York home.[45] Johansson gave birth to their son in August 2021.[46] Jost is also stepfather to Johansson's daughter from a previous marriage.\n\nJost, along with fellow SNL comedian Pete Davidson, has also purchased a decommissioned Staten Island Ferry boat.[47][48][49]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nBibliography [ edit ]\n\nAwards and honors [ edit ]",

News on Monday, May 7, 2018\n\nWhen the paparazzi erupted, she took a brief moment from hitting each pose to say something we have all wanted to say at one point or another thus far in 2018.\n\n\u201cCALM DOWN!\u201d\n\nThe best part? They did. She spoke. They listened. Blake Lively has just done something no other celebrity has done. Calmed down crazy photographers without A) Throwing something at them, B) causing bodily harm or C) breaking their camera.\n\nAfter playfully, but totally seriously, telling everyone to take a chill pill she went back to effortlessly posing for pictures.\n\nLively\u2019s era fueled gown is an Atelier Versace. She told Vogue, \u201cThis year\u2019s may be my favorite dress ever.\u201d It executed this year\u2019s Met Gala them of \u201cHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.\u201d The red dress took more than 600 hours to create with intricate beading throughout. Lively styles herself and knew she needed something great to go with her dress to pull it all together. So she enlisted the help of her friend and jewelry designer, Lorraine Schwartz. \u201cShe\u2019s looking at the beading of my dress and designing a piece based on that,\u201d Lively told E!News.\n\nHer heels came from Christian Louboutin. \u201cI just sent Lorraine Schwartz and Christian Louboutin my dress, and said, \u2018Ok let\u2019s do something special,'\u201d said the Gossip Girl actress. Lively continued to say that it\u2019s so special that, \u201cThey\u2019re making something custom for it. So it\u2019s kind of nice, because I have a bunch of artists around me who I have direct relationships with.\u201d\n\nWhen you are slaying a Versace gown, Louboutin shoes and custom jewelery and tell people to \u201ccalm down,\u201d they probably will.\n\nWhat has been your mood this 2018?",

I was the person that if you had a baby at a party, I would go up to them and shake their hand. On planes when babies would cry, I would be mad at the families. Now I\u2019m like, \u2018Let them cry!

I heard Oprah was gonna do it, so we did this instead,\u201d Colbert joked. \u201cI\u2019m very happy for Oprah.\u201d The host then added, \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.

Stirling was runner-up and Muniz was second runner-up.\n\nSpeaking moments after his big win, Fisher was lost for words to describe what it felt like to win, but had plenty to say about his partner Lindsay Arnold.\n\nEric McCandless via Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re both just sort of blinded and perma-smile and stoked about everything right now,\u201d Fisher, 23, said.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t words you can use to express \u2014 there\u2019s something about putting in 12 weeks of work and time and energy and blood and sweat and tears into something and being rewarded like this at the end of the day,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cThe Mirrorball is so amazing. This is so freaking cool. But the coolest part is having what we got to establish, a bond and trust and love for each other that exceeds so much in life and that\u2019s a thing that I\u2019m taking away from this for sure.\u201d\n\nHe plans to put his trophy in the center of his family\u2019s Thanksgiving table.\n\nIt is also the first Mirrorball Trophy win for Arnold, who has competed as a pro dancer since season 16.\n\nCalling winning \u201cinsane\u2019, Arnold praised her celebrity partner. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond anything I could have ever imagined. I\u2019ve come close and to finally take it with Jordan means more than I could ever say,\u201d she said.\n\nDavid Livingston/Getty Images\n\nAdam Rose via Getty Images\n\nFisher suffered a scratched cornea two weeks ago and Arnold has injured her leg so badly it was feared she would have to drop out of the competition.\n\nThe actor said the lead up to the final had been very hard going. \u201cYesterday was definitely one of the hardest days I\u2019d say after our crazy team fall apart injury day between the knee and the eye that was rough,\u201d he said after his win.\n\n\u201cI think that yesterday was a day when we both realized we just had to leave it all on the floor and that was going to be one of those moments that really counted and today was kind of about figuring out how to be as zen and calm as possible and realize that it\u2019s out of our hands and hopefully America saw our journey and was a part of it and supported us and voted for us and they did!\u201d\n\nEric McCandless via Getty Images\n\nBut their hard work paid off in the end.\n\n\u201cYour skills are just ridiculously out of this world. But what\u2019s amazing is you\u2019re an incredible dancer, an incredible performer, but what I\u2019ve noticed the most that makes you stand out to me is what you\u2019ve done with Lindsay,\u201d judge Carrie Ann Inaba said after Fisher\u2019s final number. \u201cLindsay has actually grown as a pro with you and that is a testament to you. You are spectacular. And Lindsay, you made him spectacular.\u201d\n\nHead judge Len Goodman also praised Fisher\u2019s talent and dancing skills: \u201cI think you are the most complete male celebrity ever on Dancing with the Stars.\u201d\n\nAlthough 23-year-old Fisher was the front-runner all season, Goodman admitted ahead of the finale that he had \u201cno clue\u201d who would be named champion.\n\nEric McCandless via Getty Images\n\n\u201cThis is becoming the war on the floor because I\u2019m so excited about tomorrow evening because I have no clue who\u2019s going to win! It\u2019s just become a fantastic competition,\u201d Goodman said after Stirling performed her freestyle dance Monday, when she earned two perfect scores.\n\nFisher, who previously starred in Hamilton and Grease Live!, admitted earlier in the season that he credits actor Corbin Bleu for inspiring him to pursue a career in the entertainment industry.\n\nBleu, who was the runner-up on season 17 of the ABC show, was paired with Fisher and Arnold for their Trio Night salsa number.\n\n\u201cFrom career to the look to the personality, it\u2019s kind of like looking in a mirror. I remember watching High School Musical, he came on and I was like, \u2018Whoa! He looks like me! I\u2019ve never seen a mixed kid doing film and TV,\u2019 \u201d Fisher said of Bleu, who starred as Chad Danforth on the Disney Channel production.\n\n\u201cThat was the moment where I went, \u2018That\u2019s what I want to do. That\u2019s what I want to do,\u2019 \u201d said Fisher.\n\nWATCH: The Cost of Dancing With the Stars\u2019 Mirrorball Trophy\n\nWhile Fisher continues to amaze audiences both in front of the camera and on the dance floor, his ultimate goal is to be a husband and father one day.\n\nThe triple threat, who was adopted by his maternal grandmother and stepgrandfather \u2014 whom he calls his mom and dad \u2014 told PEOPLE that his close-knit family has inspired him to one day start a family of his own.\n\n\u201cMy adoption journey fully fuels my inspiration, my drive, what my vision of success is. My ultimate goal in my life is to have a family,\u201d he shared with PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cI want to be an incredible father, an incredible husband and take great care of my wife and all my kids and do what I love to do during the day to provide for them,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cThat, ultimately, is what I see as being successful. I just aspire to be even half of how wonderful as my parents are.\u201d\n\nBut the DWTS journey is not over for Fisher and Muniz.

But now that her schedule is less consumed by Grey's, she'll have time to take a look at what else the industry has to offer.\n\nShe's also got four children and a husband, whom she frequently features on her Instagram accounts, and she's proven that she's accustomed to having a lot on her plate. \"A lot of people, especially who are working moms, say it\u2019s all about balance and trying to create a balance, and I respectfully disagree. I don\u2019t know that any part of my day is ever balanced,\" Capshaw told Yahoo late last year. \"I don\u2019t spend equal parts being mom or being a worker, being a wife, being an advocate, being a humanitarian, whatever it is that I am endeavoring to be.\"\n\nAs she mentioned, Capshaw is definitely an advocate \u2014 she's always sharing causes that are important to her, like ending gun violence and achieving pay equity. No matter where she goes from here, something tells me she'll be busy with something. And regardless of where her career goes, it's clear that her role as Arizona will always stay with her.\n\n\"I never would have imagined that I would be able to play a character that would feel like it does so much good, whether it\u2019s people who feel like the character resonates with them and it makes their day a little easier to see themselves represented,\" she said in the same Yahoo interview. \"Or if it\u2019s someone watching it who has someone in their life who is gay and they might have not understood it before and all of a sudden, they have another person or another thing to point to and say, \u2018Oh that\u2019s a different context.\u2019 Being able to play a lesbian as a series regular on television has been enormously rewarding.\"\n\nThere's no denying Arizona has been a hugely inspiring figure on Grey's \u2014 she's wowed viewers with her passion for the tiny humans she's healed over the years, she remained resilient in the face of unimaginable hardship, and she was always a friend to those around her. The loss of both her and April will be hard, but it's far from the last we'll see of the actors behind them.",

And I just, I\u2019ve got a lot of emotions. I don\u2019t even know what to say. I mean, it\u2019s sad. It\u2019s sad for me, but I\u2019m putting myself to work, keeping myself busy, and trying to move past it and move on to the next chapter of my life.\u201d\n\nAs for D\u2019Agostino, \u201cWe\u2019re not hanging out, but we\u2019re on friendly terms, let\u2019s put it that way,\u201d she said, adding that they intended to settle things swiftly: \u201cWe wanted it to be amicable, and that\u2019s how we live our lives. \u201d\n\nThe businessman\u2019s attorney, Daniel Lipschutz, confirms the case was amicably settled and that uncontested divorce papers were submitted Sept. 18 after D\u2019Agostino filed for divorce in early August. Asked if there was a prenuptial agreement, he had no comment.\n\nNow, De Lesseps is focusing on healing Florida with the Red Cross.\n\n\u201cI deeply pray for a better tomorrow,\u201d she wrote on Instagram Tuesday. \u201cToday is a very sad day. I am going to do whatever I can in whatever capacity to help. Heading to the Florida Keys to help with the Red Cross because they are still in need #florida #puertorico #texas #lasvegas spread love not hate #comfort #love #worldincrisis #help.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease help in any capacity that you can,\u201d she urged. \u201cWhether you donate your time or money, it doesn\u2019t matter what matters is that every little bit helps. I registered with the @americanredcross when hurricane Harvey hit Texas back in August but it takes some time to go through the application process. So start the application now with any charity of your liking. We can all chip in to help humanity! The world needs love and we can provide it.\u201d\n\nDe Lesseps wed D\u2019Agostino on Dec. 31, 2016, in a lavish, three-day celebration in Palm Beach, Florida, attended by several friends of the bride from the Housewives franchise.\n\nThe Bravo star, 52, was married to Count Alexandre de Lesseps for 16 years. D\u2019Agostino, 50, had not previously been married.\n\nBeset by doubts about their relationship throughout their whirlwind courtship, the pair weathered split rumors in mid-July, with a source telling PEOPLE the couple had hit a \u201cmajor rough patch.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom and I are in love, and marriage takes work,\u201d she told PEOPLE at the time. \u201cWe are working on this together.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 3, de Lesseps officially announced their divorce via Twitter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s with great sadness that Tom & I agreed to divorce,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe care for each other very much, hope you respect our privacy during this sad time!\u201d\n\nDe Lesseps later told PEOPLE that \u201cthis has been one of the toughest times of my life.\u201d\n\nStill, she\u2019s been working on \u201creconnecting\u201d with herself, \u201cfocusing on my family and my business.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to pour my heart into music again,\u201d she revealed. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been working on a book about resilience, about how I bounce back no matter what life throws at me.

Putting together all this trauma and religious zealousness and abuse that I don\u2019t know anything about, that really intrigued me as an actress.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, Jessica Biel was raising her baby boy with husband Justin Timberlake in their Hollywood Hills home when the actress got hooked on a book. Universal Cable Productions sent her a thriller by German crime novelist Petra Hammesfahr, and once Biel started reading \u201cThe Sinner,\u201d she couldn\u2019t put it down. \u201cEvery time I thought I knew where the story was going, it surprised me,\u201d she says. \u201cI liked the book\u2019s subversive quality. It was an impressive read.\u201d\n\nThose subversive elements, embodied in the deeply damaged title character, proved irresistible to Biel. She explains, \u201cI hadn\u2019t worked on screen for a year, so I was ready to take the knife and let my guts spill out everywhere because I had all this creative energy that needed to be expelled. This was a leap into the darkest of the dark.\u201d\n\nOn this day, the sun streaming into a penthouse at AKA Beverly Hills, where Biel, wearing a violet pantsuit with a cream coat draped over her shoulders, cheerfully details her deep dive into \u201cThe Sinner.\u201d \u201cIt was exciting to play this unreliable character who lies out of self-preservation and because she\u2019s afraid to expose parts of herself she believes are heinous and shameful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA hit for USA Network last summer, the limited series earned Biel a Golden Globe best actress nomination for her nuanced portrayal of mom/wife/shattered soul Cora. The character\u2019s psychotic break happens in the first episode. During a picnic by the lake with her husband and young son, Cora gets enraged by a loud song and abruptly stabs a stranger to death in a blood-spattered rage.\n\nWhy\u2019d she do it?\n\nSeeking answers, the eight-episode thriller gradually reveals Cora\u2019s toxic backstory, contaminated with psychologically abusive parents, a sickly sister and predatory men in masks. \u201cOther people can do whodunit really well,\u201d Biel says. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in the conceit of the \u2018whydunit,\u2019 so we peel, peel, peel away. It\u2019s about the psychological peel.\u201d\n\nBiel\u2019s star turn in \u201cThe Sinner\u201d represents a startling departure for the 36-year-old actress, first introduced to TV audiences as a minister\u2019s wholesome teenage daughter in The WB\u2019s long-running family drama \u201c7th Heaven.\u201d She later appeared in the 2003 horror reboot of \u201cThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre\u201d followed by an eclectic mix of action flicks, rom-coms, guest roles and voiceover gigs.\n\nWith \u201cThe Sinner,\u201d Biel broke new ground by probing a character she has almost nothing in common with. \u201cGrowing up totally normal, I had cool, loving parents, went to school. I worked professionally, which was a little bit unusual, but in terms of dynamic there\u2019s nothing to really say except \u2018Thumbs up.\u2019 And I don\u2019t want to play that! It\u2019s boring! I want to find characters I\u2019m terrified to portray.\u201d\n\nMy entry point for Cora was partly that we\u2019re both moms, so I had compassion for her in that way. \u2014 Jessica Biel\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiel did manage to identify with Cora in one regard. \u201cMy entry point for Cora was partly that we\u2019re both moms, so I had compassion for her in that way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the attraction also had to do with the fact that Cora has so many layers. Putting together all this trauma and religious zealousness and abuse that I don\u2019t know anything about, that really intrigued me as an actress.\u201d\n\nCora\u2019s fitfully remembered past includes a complicated relationship with her bossy younger sister Phoebe (Nadia Alexander), whose options are constrained because of a congenital heart defect. Incest ensues. Biel says, \u201cThat scene was odd to film and uncomfortable to watch. But Phoebe needs that physical release because she doesn\u2019t feel that she\u2019ll ever be touched or loved or caressed. Cora can\u2019t say no. She did it out of love.\u201d\n\nBeyond her contributions as an actress, Biel exercised considerable measure of creative control over \u201cThe Sinner\u201d through her Iron Ocean Productions company. She and producing partner Michelle Purple enlisted show runner Derek Simonds (\u201cThe Astronaut Wives Club\u201d) to create the series and personally pitched their concept to network execs. Biel, who continues as an executive producer for \u201cThe Sinner\u201d Season 2, which will star Carrie Coon, liked being listened to.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a powerful feeling to have people look to you and say \u2018What do you think?\u2019 Actors often don\u2019t have any input at all, but I\u2019d been living with \u2018The Sinner\u2019 longer than almost anybody, so I had a point of view about the material. This show definitely felt like my baby.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Video Q&A\u2019s from this season\u2019s hottest contenders \u00bb\n\ncalendar@latimes.com",

Kaling's daughter's middle name has been reported, and, well, you're going to shed even more tears once you hear it. According to a birth certificate The Blast and Entertainment Tonight reportedly obtained, the creator and former star of The Mindy Project named her baby girl Katherine Swati Kaling.\n\nNow, here's why Swati is such a special name \u2014 it is the first name of Kaling's late mother, Swati Roysircar, who died in 2012 from pancreatic cancer. Kaling and her mother had an amazing relationship, and one that the multi-hyphenate has talked about on multiple occasions.\n\nIn November 2013, Lena Dunham interviewed Kaling for RollingStone.com. After the Girls creator asked Kaling about her role model in life, the Office actor said, \"I would say that my mother is the single biggest role model in my life, but that term doesn't seem to encompass enough when I use it about her. She was the love of my life.\"\n\nSo much so that Kaling's Mindy Project character, Dr. Mindy Lahiri, was loosely based on her mom, who was an OB/GYN. Actually, Roysircar died on Jan. 30, 2012, the same day Fox picked up The Mindy Project. \"I'm not superstitious,\" Kaling told Good Housekeeping in January 2015, \"but I think my mom had some part in it.\" She added, \"My mom was my soul mate.\"\n\nIf all of that didn't make you weep, get ready for this. While chatting with Us Weekly in September, Mindy Project's Ed Weeks said about Kaling having a baby, \"The show started as a tribute to her mother, who very sadly passed away just as the show [was] being picked up.\" The fact that Kaling got pregnant with her own daughter during the final season of her show made it all the more meaningful. Weeks continued, \"When she reminded us all of that, we all cried in the final table read. I mean Jesus, life! It makes some very interesting and beautiful patterns sometimes.\"\n\nThe way Kaling has reportedly chosen to honor her mother is truly wonderful. Even though her daughter won't ever personally know her grandmother, she can walk around knowing she's keeping Roysircar's spirit alive by having her first name as her middle name.\n\nIt was reported by E! News Tuesday that Kaling gave birth to her first child. (At the time of the report, Bustle reached out to Kaling's rep for comment, but did not receive an immediate response.)\n\nWhen Kaling confirmed her pregnancy to Today in August, she said, \"It\u2019s so unknown to me. I have a lot of control over a lot of aspects of my life, and this is one where I\u2019m like, 'OK, it\u2019s out of my hands,' which is kind of a fun feeling.\" She, then, of course, brought up her mom. \"My mom was incredibly fierce and so devoted to us, just loved us and really wanted us to be happy no matter what we did.\" She continued, \"My career choice was not something that she was familiar with and she was just so supportive of that. And if I could give that to my child, just that open-mindedness, I\u2019d be so happy.\"\n\nBased on the relationship Kaling had with her own mother, there's no doubt she and her daughter will share the same bond.",

        "content": "I've never worked in an office with a dress code that required a button-up shirt, pencil skirt, slacks, a blazer, or the like. Working in fashion, my sartorial choices have been pretty unregulated by my past employers. But seeing as summer 2018 trends include bright and breezy suits that are perfect for warm weather weekdays and weekends alike, I just might need to add an office-inspired look into my everyday wardrobe.\n\nJust this weekend, Bella Hadid made waves at Paris Men's Fashion Week when she arrived to the Dior Homme show in a sunny yellow pantsuit and sneakers. Slinky, relaxed in fit, and in a playful hue, the suit didn't feel stuffy or overly professional and was just one in a lineup of matching two-pieces that street style photographers captured over the weekend. Indeed, summer-perfect suits\u2014those in vivid hues, bright prints, and with playful embellishments\u2014with sneakers have been a favorite of stylists, models, and editors as of late.\n\nWhile I am partial to the relaxed trouser and jacket combo (I like the way shapeless blazers fall on my frame and will never say to ultra comfy pants), there are endless silhouette options out there to choose from based on your style preferences. Shorts, cropped pants, fitted blazers \u2014 nothing is off-limits, and if you want to make sure your suit fits you like a literal glove I'd recommend checking out custom suiting options.\n\nFrancois Durand/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nCheck out some of the most fun and versatile suits on the market right now below. Whether you choose to pair them with sneakers or something more professional is up to you. Either way, you'll look like a total boss babe.\n\nGreen With Envy\n\nThis suit has it all, from a loose, relaxed fit and cropped legs to a bright kelly green shade. It would look perfect paired with sneakers and a white bralette for a casual brunch with friends or with white sandals and earrings like above for a chilled office environment. Power suit, indeed.\n\nIcon Outfit\n\nDo you remember that iconic photo of Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss in the '90s wherein Campbell is wearing the most killer blue plaid look ever? This is the modern day version of it, just less silkier and more wearable. I love the buttons and belt detailing on the skirt and the blinding shade of cobalt it centers on. This is a suit you could transition from the office to the bar seamlessly.\n\nBaby Blue\n\nThe super light and airy hue of this suit alone sold me on including it on this list, but when I saw its classic tailored fit and 100% cotton make I knew it would be a knockout.\n\nShort Order\n\nAnother option for those of you looking for something uber casual and breezy, this shorts suit boasts a light material and classic pinstripe pattern. The shorts are long enough to still be appropriate in many office settings, while their tie waist makes them not to be taken too seriously.\n\nPepto Perfect\n\nThis deep shade of pink, which mirrors Pepto Bismol to a T, is my favorite variation of the rosy hue. And in suit form? I love it even more. While the pants to this suit are currently unavailable, the blazer is so good that I had to include it on its own thanks to the black button details and notched shawl collar. This is a jacket you can wear 100 ways and still never get bored.\n\nOptical Illusion\n\nStripes on stripes on stripes! If you're looking to make a huge statement but aren't one for candy colored hues, this eye full of a suit might be for you. As shown above, it looks stellar with any type of white footwear and a slicked back bun. Perfect for the office and beyond.",

With the blonde pixie cut reminiscent of her \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d days grown out to reveal her natural brunette roots, Cyrus donned a simple white top and shorts for her debut live performance of the track off her upcoming album. She also tossed bouquets of flowers and shot streams of water into the crowd as large balloons bounced around the stadium.\n\nAfter Cyrus\u2019 little sister, Noah, performed earlier in the day, the siblings brought their mom, Tish, onstage with a tiered birthday cake and had the entire 20,000-member crowd sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to her with the help of Labrinth.\n\nNiall Horan announced his first solo album will be out this fall. One night after he released his latest single, \u201cOn the Loose,\u201d the solo singer said he had just finished recording his album and took to the stage to perform tracks like \u201cThis Town\u201d and \u201cSlow Hands.\u201d While he didn\u2019t perform at the show, fellow former One-Direction bandmate Liam Payne announced an upcoming collaboration with Zedd.\n\nMaroon 5 performed a tribute to Prince by turning the stage lights purple as the band played a cover of the late pop star\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy.\u201d In their self-proclaimed \u201c14 thousandth time\u201d appearing at the Wango Tango, the group also played a number of their classic hits, from \u201cHarder to Breathe\u201d and \u201cThis Love\u201d to \u201cSugar\u201d and \u201cMoves Like Jagger.\u201d\n\n\u201cIssues\u201d singer Julia Michaels attended her first Wango Tango as a performer.\n\n\u201cLast year, I came here as a fan and now I\u2019m performing,\u201d the 23-year-old said. \u201cIt\u2019s so bizarre. I never thought this was going to be my life.\u201d\n\nAaron Carter made his comeback performance on the Village stage with his first appearance at the event since 2002. Carter released his latest EP, L\u00f8V\u00eb, in February 2017.\n\n\u201cThe EP was inspired by heartbreak. I was in a relationship with somebody who wasn\u2019t proud of me, was ashamed of me, didn\u2019t want to show me off to the world.\u201d\n\nHe said that initially, record labels were hesitant when he wanted to get back into music.\n\n\u201cEveryone said, \u2018No, Aaron Carter will never make it again\u2019 \u2026So it kind of motivated me to come back out and do my best.\u201d\n\nMachine Gun Kelly brought Hailee Steinfeld back onstage after her own performance for their track, \u201cAt My Best,\u201d while Camila Cabello later made an appearance during his set to perform their hit, \u201cBad Things.\u201d Other collaborations included Zedd and Alessia Cara on their single, \u201cStay,\u201d as well as Noah Cyrus and Labrinth on \u201cMake Me (Cry).\u201d\n\nNow in its 19th year, the music festival easily filled the entire LA Galaxy stadium, but the crowd wasn\u2019t too young to remember the Backstreet Boys, who returned to the Wango Tango stage for the first time since 2001. They closed the show with impressively synchronized dance moves, matching outfits, and hits such as \u201cLarger Than Life\u201d and \u201cEverybody (Backstreet\u2019s Back).\u201d\n\nMain stage artists included Katy Perry, Maroon 5, Niall Horan, Luis Fonsi, Backstreet Boys, Zedd with Alessia Cara, Machine Gun Kelly, Camila Cabello, Hailee Steinfeld, Noah Cyrus, Halsey, Julia Michaels and Miley Cyrus.\n\nPre-show Village artists included Noah Cyrus, Jordan Fisher, Aaron Carter, Olivia Holt, Ocean Park Standoff and Hey Violet.\n\nSee fans\u2019 reactions to the performances below:\n\n#maroon5 nailing yet another Prince song \u2014- #wangotango #kiisfm A post shared by ?\u2014-Kym\u2014-?

He came across just like a brother trying to connect with his sister and it really wasn\u2019t that different than if I were connecting any random person to their brother,\u201d the 22-year-old medium continued.\n\n\u201cAnd it was just really special because it showed universally these connections are all something we can relate to. And even if we\u2019re a celebrity in life, they still connect on a personal level on the other side.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nConspiracy theories were rife after Jackson\u2019s death with many claiming it was faked to escape the pressure of fame.\n\nWebsites such as michaeljacksonsightings.com and michaeljacksonhoaxdeath.com have been registered to help \u201cexplain\u201d what happened.\n\nJust about the only explanation they do not consider is that he collapsed and died of a heart attack due to the stress of his comeback concert series, This Is It.\n\nInstead, they make a raft of outlandish claims, including theories he is hiding in eastern Europe; he headed to Bahrain, where the royal family are looking after him; and he hopped across the US-Mexico border.\n\nA selfie taken by daughter Paris Jackson, in which a shadowy figure that resembled Micheal appeared to be lurking, fuelled these claims.\n\nAnd other fans claim they saw the singer at the wedding of his nephew, Siggy Jackson in December.",

In May, she was sentenced for bankruptcy fraud and bringing $120,000 worth of Australian currency into the country without reporting it.\n\nIn addition to prison time, a federal judge also ordered her to pay a $40,000 fine and spend two years on probation after her release.\n\nIn the case, prosecutors said Miller was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy when she tried to hide $775,000 worth of income from her Lifetime network reality show and its spinoffs.\n\nThe investigation began when a channel-surfing bankruptcy judge saw Miller on TV in December 2012 and figured she had to be making more than the $8,899 in monthly income she was claiming.\n\nEntertainment Tonight caught up with Miller at a red-carpet event in Los Angeles on Saturday night, when she talked about her pending imprisonment.\n\n\"I'll just have me to concentrate on and that\u2019s different,\" she told Entertainment Tonight. \"I\u2019ve always put everybody else\u2019s child first, before my own health, before my own outfit, before my own time frame. Everybody else was dressed and out the door and looking perfect and I was running around trying to find a clean towel to take a shower with, so I think this will be a little 'me' time.\"\n\nMiller announced in March 2016 that she was leaving Dance Moms. In an Instagram post, she declared that she would no longer participate in the series as she had \"ASKED, BEGGED, AND EVEN DEMANDED CREATIVE CREDIT FOR ALL THE IDEAS, AWARD WINNING ROUTINES, THEMES, AND COSTUMING\" without success.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press",

Affleck called his colleague's actions unacceptable, but many Twitter users crudely reminded him that he was no better with his sketchy past. When a user brought up Hilarie Burton's accusation that Affleck groped her on camera on TRL in 2003, others began sharing the video of the incident, making it go viral.\n\nThe actor soon released a statement, saying that he was sincerely asking for Ms. Burton's forgiveness after he acted inappropriately towards her. The controversy did not die down, though. Makeup artist Annamarie Tendler revealed that the actor inappropriately touched her during a Golden Globes party in 2014 and was also asking for a public apology. A televised interview of Affleck flirting with Canadian TV host Anne-Marie Losique also went viral. She said, though, that nothing \"improper\" happened even though she was sitting on the actor's lap.\n\nAmidst all the hoopla, Garner has kept her silence, preferring to stay out of the limelight and focus on their kids. The couple previously announced their separation in June 2015. Affleck, however, continued to live on the same property as Garner to co-parent their three children: Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5. Last Halloween, they went trick-or-treating with the kids in Malibu. They were photographed accompanying the little ones while collecting candies in the neighborhood.\n\nE! News reports, though, that Garner is actually very annoyed with the whole situation. The actress is allegedly doing her best to show their children that everything is all right, but she is frustrated with her ex-husband.\n\n\"[She] is very annoyed because it just means more attention on her and the kids as a result of Ben's actions,\" a source claimed. \"She tries to shield them from any and all publicity and scrutiny. She's taking her kids to school and to all of their activities. As far as they know nothing has changed and all is well. That is always her goal but she's been pretty frustrated with him.\"",

She is also on the board of Weight Watchers.\n\nAnd the value of Oprah's stock in Weight Watchers has increased by nearly $35 million since she first disclosed her investment in October 2015.\n\nBut the stock has been on a wild yo-yo ride over the past year.\n\nRelated: Weight watching? Here's how Oprah can help\n\nWhile Oprah may be making big bucks on Weight Watchers, that's not the case for investors who only bought after finding out that she was involved.\n\nShares of Weight Watchers have plummeted nearly 50% this year and are down about 60% from the highest post-Oprah investment price they hit in November 2015.\n\nThe stock has bounced around a lot -- often due to stories about Oprah and her weight.\n\nRelated: Weight Watchers investors obsessed with Oprah\n\nShares surged in late January thanks to a tweet and video from Oprah in which she declared \"Eat bread. Lose weight. Whaaatttt?\" and said that she had already lost 26 pounds.\n\nBut investors got a rude awakening a month later when Weight Watchers reported a surprise quarterly loss as well as a decline in sales, subscribers and attendance at the company's meetings.\n\nThe stock popped again in August after there was another story about Oprah's weight loss on People's website that then got more play thanks to the New York Post's Page Six celebrity gossip feature.\n\nOprah told People at a premiere for the OWN Network show \"Queen Sugar\" that she's lost so much weight using the diet service that longtime boyfriend Stedman Graham \"can pick me up and carry me to the pool. I can straddle him without breaking his back.\"\n\nPage Six naturally chose \"Oprah can now straddle Stedman 'without breaking his back'\" as the headline for its blurb.\n\nBut Oprah's endorsement of the company hasn't changed its fortunes. The company faces tough competition from other diet services. Shares of Nutrisystem (NTRI) have surged nearly 70% this year, for example.\n\nRelated: Weight Watchers CEO calling it quits after tumultuous year\n\nMany weight watchers also have decided that they don't need to pay a monthly subscription to Weight Watchers for diet tips, recipes and exercise and fitness advice either. There are tons of free weight loss apps for smartphones.\n\nWeight Watchers still faces many challenges. In fact, the company announced in September that its CEO James Chambers was stepping down after he failed to turn the company around.\n\nThe company did report earnings in November that topped Wall Street's forecasts. So there are some signs of a turnaround taking hold. But analysts expect sales to rise less than 1% this year and only increase by about 5% next year.\n\nSo even though it's great news for Oprah that she's been able to lose so much weight, investors that still own Weight Watchers stock might want to make dumping shares their New Year's resolution.",

Without Bieber, though, the chart-topping tune would still be nonexistent \u2014 or may have never even come to fruition.\n\nExplore See latest videos, charts and news Ed Sheeran Justin Bieber See latest videos, charts and news\n\n\u201cThat was a song I had written for Divide. It just wouldn\u2019t have made it,\u201d Sheeran explained in an interview with Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio Monday morning (Jan. 9). \u201cAnd then Justin took it and did his thing on it, and released it as a single and made it what it is. So going from a song that would have never been released to [being] the biggest song of last year \u2014 it just became Billboard\u2018s #1 of 2016 of the whole year, and [was] nominated for Song of the Year at the GRAMMYs \u2014 it just shows you that you shouldn\u2019t always write stuff off.\u201d\n\nSheeran didn\u2019t elaborate on what kind of touch Bieber had on the song, but he made sure to give the Purpose singer some credit. \u201c[Justin] did have input on it, I wouldn\u2019t say it was just all me.\u201d\n\nThose who pay close attention to Bieber\u2019s Twitter may have noticed that Sheeran also had a role in another one of the Bieb\u2019s 2016 hits: the Major Lazer/M\u00d8 collaboration \u201cCold Water.\u201d But before Sheeran actually heard the track, he didn\u2019t realize he had written yet another smash for Bieber.\n\n\u201c\u2018Cold Water\u2019 was a weird one because I didn\u2019t even know that song existed,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt was a song I must\u2019ve half-written somewhere at a time where I was writing a lot of songs and I did it at Benny Blanco\u2019s house and then I got an email from Diplo just being like, \u2018Yo! That \u2018Cold Water\u2019 song is dope! Can I have it?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u2019 so I just didn\u2019t reply. And then he emailed and was like, \u201cYo, Justin [Bieber] wants to hop on the \u2018Cold Water\u2019 song. Is that cool?\u2019 And I\u2019m just like, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019\u2026 And then the song came out and it was number one and I was like \u2018Oh, that song!\u2019 I remember doing it, but it was really, really slow. I remember hearing it and being like \u2018That kind of sounds like me. Oh wait, it was me.'\u201d\n\nWhile fans may never get to hear Sheeran\u2019s versions of \u201cCold Water\u201d or \u201cLove Yourself\u201d \u2014 though he did give one live performance of the latter in December \u2014 they did get a sneak peak last week of what\u2019s to come with Divide. Sheeran released \u201cCastle on the Hill,\u201d an homage to his hometown of Suffolk, England, and the sexually charged \u201cShape of You,\u201d which both shot to the top of iTunes on Friday (Jan. 6), and set a Spotify record in their first 24 hours of release.\n\nSheeran revealed on Jan. 12 that Divide will be dropping March 3, and has previously said that he will be sharing a few more new tunes from the LP prior to its release.

        "content": "It is weirdly satisfying when your favorite TV couple ends up together off-screen. Real romance just elevates your OTP to a whole new level, so it is no surprise that many Full House fans have always wondered whether Aunt Becky and Uncle Jesse ever dated in real life. Or, in other words, whether Lori Loughlin and John Stamos ever dated in real life. It's a fair question to ask: Their chemistry has always been off the charts thanks to their wicked onscreen banter skills. Together, they gave Full House its one great romance. But, were Loughlin and Stamos ever as madly in love with each other as their characters were and will continue to be on Netflix's Fuller House?\n\nWell, the short answer is no. The stars never quite aligned for Loughlin and Stamos, but they may or may not have had a date at the most magical place on Earth \u2014 aka, Disneyland \u2014 depending on which one of them you ask.\n\nIn an interview with People magazine, Loughlin revealed Stamos invited her to see a band play in Disneyland way before their Full House days. At the time, they were both young actors just starting out in the business who also happened to be friends. Loughlin agreed to accompany Stamos to Disneyland, but she told People, she was never quite sure if their friendly outing counted as a true date. While she tends to think no, Stamos is firmly in the \"it was a real date\" camp, and they have been arguing over the semantics for years. \"We fight internally about that,\" Loughlin told People. \"I'm like, 'Was that a date?' He's like, 'Yeah!'\"\n\nWhat makes Stamos so sure it was a date? Well, there was definitely kissing involved, according to him. \"As I recall, we ended up kissing,\" Stamos said. \"That sounds like a date, right?\" Have mercy! That definitely sounds date like to me, but that could just be my inner Uncle Jesse and Aunt Becky shipper talking. Also, just take a moment to appreciate how these two bicker like an old married couple.\n\nAnyway, it looks like that one maybe-date in their teens will have to satisfy the cravings of Full House fans looking for a real life romance between the duo. By the time Loughlin joined Full House she was married to her first husband, Michael R. Burns \u2014 and by the time Loughlin and Burns were divorced, Stamos was married to Rebecca Romijn. Now Stamos is single, but Loughlin has been happily married to Mossimo Giannulli for 18 years, and the couple has two daughters.\n\nAs cool as a real life romance between Aunt Becky and Uncle Jesse would have been, it's even better knowing the actors are still friends. Plus, the love between their characters will live on in Fuller House and as a committed Aunt Becky/Uncle Jesse shipper there is no better news than that.\n\nImages: Warner Bros.

Usually, the fascinator is worn during the ceremony and the reception, but will often be taken off in the evening or during dinner.\n\nA fascinator may seem ostentatious to those who aren't used to the style, but they are staples in a Brit's wardrobe.\n\nCatherine, Duchess of Cambridge attends the wedding of Pippa Middleton and James Matthews at St Mark's Church on May 20, 2017 in Englefield Green, England. UK Press via Getty Images\n\n\"Originally, fascinators were smaller, with little decorations,\" Suzanne Cotton, the fashion design chair at Columbus College of Art and Design, told \"Good Morning America.\" \"But in the William and Kate years, fascinators became an over-the-top accessory. I definitely think they\u2019ve evolved from being a small, pretty thing like a little piece of netting with a flower to being these very over-the-top fashion statements.\"\n\nFascinators can come in all shapes and sizes, but they do have certain parameters.\n\nA fascinator is a decorative hat that is typically large and attached to a headband, small combs or an elastic back.\n\n\"They\u2019re attached to headbands, they\u2019re easy to wear, and they still allow you to make a bold fashion statement,\" Cotton said.\n\nHow did the fascinator get its name?\n\nThe word \u201cfascinator\u201d may trace its roots back to the Latin word \"fascinatus,\" which means to bewitch, according to Cotton.\n\n\"And I think fascinators can certainly do that,\" Cotton said. \"They give people a chance to make a bold fashion statement.\"\n\nWhen did fascinators come onto the fashion scene?\n\nFascinators have been used for hundreds of years, according to fashion experts, but Cotton contends they've been through quite an evolution since their advent.\n\n\"In the 19th and 20th centuries, fascinators were light knitted headpieces, but the modern fascinator ... really became popular in the 1980s and \u201990s,\" Cotton said.\n\nPrincess Beatrice departs the Royal Wedding of Prince William to Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London. UK Press via Getty Images\n\nSandra Walcott, an adjunct assistant professor for the Fashion Institute of Technology's Accessories Design Department, told \"GMA\" the fascinator became popular after milliners Stephen Jones and Philip Treacy created some creative pieces for London celebrities.\n\nJones had Diana, Princess of Wales, as a consistent client due to his avant-garde designs in the early 1980s.\n\nTreacy is a favorite of many international celebrities, such as Sarah Jessica Parker and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Of the various transfixing fascinators worn to Prince William and Kate Middleton's 2011 wedding, 36 of them were Treacy's.\n\nMost notably, Princess Beatrice's oddly shaped fascinator she wore to William and Kate's ceremony was designed by Treacy.\n\nPrincess Eugenie of York arrives to the Royal Wedding of Prince William to Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London. Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nBut Beatrice wasn't alone in her peculiar debut at that particular royal wedding. Right by her side, was Princess Eugenie of York.\n\n\"The most famous fascinator that I remember is the one worn by Princess Eugenie,\" Walcott said. \"The fascinator is said to be 'outlandish' due to its large size, odd shape, and awkward placement at the front of the head.\"\n\nWhy do British women wear them?\n\nFascinators became prevalent because there's a feeling in Britain that one is not fully dressed without something on your head, according to Walcott.\n\n\"Think of the expression 'dressed from head to toe,'\" she added.\n\nThe accessory also helps bring the eyes upward, Walcott noted, towards a person's face, and can enhance a woman's overall look.\n\nBut Cotton has a practical theory on why they are so widely worn.\n\n\"I think fascinators became popular because they don\u2019t mess with your hair,\" she said.\n\nZara Phillips and Chanelle McCoy attend day 2 'Ladies Day' of the Cheltenham Festival at Cheltenham Racecourse on March 14, 2018 in Cheltenham, England. Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images\n\nCotton is skeptical about what the fashion forecast is for fascinators, as she feels they may have hit their peak in the fashion world.\n\n\"Treacy has said the fascinator is dead, so I\u2019m curious to see how many fascinators we\u2019ll see at the royal wedding,\" Cotton said.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle will wed on May 19, a day where jubilant attendees may show the fashion world whether fascinators are still hot or not.",

For me,\u201d he said in GQ\u2019s new cover story. In 2016, Fisher dropped a bombshell on fans of the franchise when she revealed in her memoir, The Princess Diarist, that she and Ford had an affair while on the set of the film that started the franchise,1977\u2019s Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope.\n\nAt the time, Fisher was 19 and Ford was 33 \u2013 and married to his first wife, Mary Marquardt, with whom he had two children.\n\nThe steadfastly private actor admitted that he was given advance warning that Fisher planned to write about their affair (\u201cto a degree\u201d), but declined to go into detail about his reaction.\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, with Carrie\u2019s untimely passing, I don\u2019t really feel that it\u2019s a subject that I want to discuss.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he\u2019s read Fisher\u2019s nearly 300-page memoir, Ford responded shortly, \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFord remained silent throughout Fisher\u2019s promotional tours and interviews for the book, though he was often asked for comment. In a chat with NPR\u2019s Fresh Air host Terry Gross in late November of that year, Fisher expressed surprise that readers made such a big deal out of the three-month affair.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I found the journals that I kept during the first movie, and I\u2019m probably going to publish them,'\u201d she said of the conversation she had with Harrison prior to moving forward with that chapter of the memoir. \u201cAnd he just sort of raised his finger and said, \u2018Lawyer!\u2019 Then I said, \u2018No, I won\u2019t write anything that you don\u2019t want. I mean, I\u2019ll show it to you before and you can take anything out that you want taken out. I don\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable\u2019 \u2013 which I, of course, have.

The women of the show gathered on a special Los Angeles edition of \u201cWatch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen\u201d last night. The stars joined Cohen on stage at the Wiltern Theatre to answer some fan questions and things escalated quickly. The ladies did not hold back on their snarky comments toward not only one another but audience members.\n\nThrowing shade\n\nAccording to E! News, one fan asked the stars what their taglines for each other would be.\n\nCohen said that Lisa Vanderpump had a \u201cvery shady one\u201d for her fellow co-star and fremeny Lisa Rinna. Vanderpump admitted, \"Oh, I just said, \u2018Go back to selling dusters and diapers.\u201d This was an obvious reference to Lisa Rinna\u2019s clothing line on QVC and her once appearing in a Depend commercial.\n\nRinna, who is known on the show for not holding back was quick to reply, \"And guess what, honey? Guess what? Do you know how much I've made on those dusters and diapers? A lot more than your restaurants I'm sure.\" This was once again a very obvious reference to Vanderpump\u2019s many restaurants, which includes the very popular SUR (the home base of hit show \"Vanderpump Rules\").\n\nFans as well as friend and co-star Kyle Richards appeared shocked at the shade although they probably should not have been because Rinna and Vanderpump have a very rocky friendship history.\n\nEven more drama\n\nBut this was just the start of the night\u2019s shady comments. A fan asked Dorit Kemsley, \"which glass goes well with coke?\" This question was about a few incidents involving Kemsley. One being her distaste when she was given Rose wine in a champagne glass and then of course it hinted at the infamous implication that Rinna made inferring Kemsley was doing cocaine during a dinner party.\n\nA claim that Kemsley fiercely denied.\n\nKemsley, who, according to her co-stars and fans, was the \u201cpot stirrer\u201d of the season, had no problem clapping back, saying: \"I wouldn't know, sour patch.\" She then went on to insult the fact that the questioner wanted to set up her son with Cohen, adding, \"I wonder why your son's having trouble getting married.\"\n\nEven Cohen seemed shocked by the shade happening on his late night talk show. This \u201cWatch What Happens Live\u201d seems to be foreshadowing the drama of the upcoming \u201cReal Housewives of beverly hills\u201d reunion.\n\nBe sure to tune in to all the drama every Tuesday at 9PM on Bravo.",

The \u201cHands To Myself\u201d singer shocked the world when she revealed on Sept. 14 that her best friend Francia Raisa, 29, donated one of her kidneys to Selena after her Lupus condition required the operation earlier this summer.

He is generally happy she is okay, but that is all he wants to deal with right now when it comes to her,\u201d a source close to the Biebs tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. See pics from Selena\u2019s kidney transplant, here.\n\nEven though they both go to Hillsong Church, Selena kept word of her surgery super quiet and the news never made it back to Justin, according to TMZ. The site says that the pair actively keeps their distance at services. \u201cThey don\u2019t talk. Period,\u201d their source claims. Another source said, \u201cIt was a childhood thing.

Selena\u2019s been blissfully happy dating The Weeknd, 27, for nine months now and he was totally her \u201crock\u201d during the medical crisis. Even though the singer was on tour, he stayed in constant contact to make sure his lady was doing well. Oh man, how stressful that must have been!

On Sunday, Kim Kardashian received birthday messages from her family on social media, and their wishes show that this family is still so close. On Instagram, both Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Kendall Jenner took the time to post a message for Kim, who celebrated her 38th birthday on October 21. Meanwhile, Kylie Jenner shared her bday message to her big sister via an Instagram Story, while their mom penned a beautiful ode to her daughter.\n\nThe family was sure to share the love online with throwback pictures and special messages. Khlo\u00e9 shared a slideshow of photos with Kim, and included a long message for her sister about how she continues to be impressed by her. The Good American founder wrote:\n\nHappy birthday sweet Kimberly!!! My entire life, you've always been someone that I look up to. To me, You are super woman!! I'm not sure how you do it all and make everything look so easy. People have no idea how selfless of a human being you are. With no credit wanted either.\n\nHer message went on to acknowledge how much the sisters have been through over the years, and how they are lucky to be able to be there for each other, even when their lives take unexpected turns. Khlo\u00e9 continued:\n\nI am so impressed by the woman, wife and mother you have become. I'm so thankful for us getting closer over the last year. You're a f****** rider! Without you I would be lost! Crazy sh*t happens to us all of the time, but how f****** lucky are we that we get to experience this crazy thing called life with one another? I know for certain, that no matter what happens to any of us, we will always be OK because we have one another. I hope you have the happiest of birthdays Keeks! I pray that every wish you have, it comes true. You are so deserving! I love you!! Until the end of time, I love you!!!\n\nThe sweet message definitely seems to allude to how motherhood has brought Khlo\u00e9 and Kim closer since the birth of little True earlier this year.\n\nOf course, Khlo\u00e9 wasn't the only family member to send Kim a happy birthday message. Kylie shared a video from the Kim X Kylie makeup collaboration to her Instagram Story, captioning the photo: \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY KIMMY I LOVE YOU\" with a party hat emoji.\n\nKris Jenner also shared a collage of photos on Instagram, and included a note about the special day as well. She wrote:\n\n\"Happy birthday Kim Kardashian!!! My beautiful girl, I love and adore you and wish for you the most amazing day and year...you have brought all of us such love, joy, and happiness. You are the best mom, wife, sister, daughter and friend and i am beyond blessed to be your Mom.\"\n\nOn her Instagram Story, Kris also shared a preview for a Keeping Up With the Kardashians birthday marathon.\n\nFinally, Kendall honored her big sister by sharing clips from Kanye West's iconic (and super nostalgic) birthday video that he made for his wife in 2016. Kendall captioned her post with, \"happy birthday to my beautiful sister @kimkardashian.\"\n\nWest was all about spreading the birthday love this year too. He shared his surprise gift for Kim \u2014 stunning flowers \u2014 on social media. The Kardashian-West family is known for pulling out all the stops when it comes to presents. In August, West surprised Kim with a lime green Mercedes SUV she'd fallen in love with driving while on vacation. It must have been difficult to pick yet another meaningful gift, but he managed to pick the perfect thing. Instead of buying a normal bouquet of flowers, West decked their home out with unique floral arrangements that hung from the ceiling.\n\nThere was more to the birthday present: West also had a pianist waiting to play music when she woke up. On Twitter, he shared a video of the scene, writing:\n\n\"You\u2019re stunning. I will keep trying to make things that can express how beautiful you are inside and out and how much I love you and our family.\"\n\nKim loved the present, and she shared the video of the birthday surprise on Twitter. She wrote: \"The most beautiful birthday flowers in the world!!!!! I have the sweetest most creative husband! Thank you babe love you so much!!!\"\n\nThe Kardashian-Wests went out of their way to celebrate Kim's special day. From the extravagant flowers to best wishes on social media, the whole crew came together to send their best to Kim on her birthday. It's clear that no matter how much drama fans see on Keeping Up With the Kardashians, this family is all about the love.",

Additionally, the message describes Edgette's reaction as \"viral\" and mentions that his tweet was liked over 715,000 times, which further supports the idea that this is a real event.\n\nGiven these factors, it seems plausible that KFC would indeed commission a painting of their founder giving Edgette a piggyback ride through a beautiful woodland landscape as a reward for his investigative work. The tone of the message and Edgette's reaction also suggest that this is not an ordinary corporate response, but rather a creative and playful gesture.\n\n1",

So when Parker appeared on The Late Show last week, she asked Stephen Colbert to fill in and play the fan-favorite character.\n\n\"He put me in a tough place,\" Parker joked to DeGeneres. \"But now I'll offer you the same opportunity. I'm going to go across the lands [to ask].\"\n\n\"There's a period of grief, a mourning process,\" she added of the thought of doing a third film without Jones. \"And then perhaps we'll be able to consider, say, for instance, you playing Samantha.\"\n\nDeGeneres couldn't help herself from chuckling over the idea, saying, \"That is me. I am a sexual beast. I talk about it a lot, I do it a lot.\"\n\nAlthough many would be thrilled for SATC 3, Parker told ET on the red carpet at the Golden Globes earlier this month that the possibility of a third film is unlikely.\n\n\"I mean, not as far as I can imagine. Unless... I mean, no,\" she said. \"No. I struggle with it because it's a bit sad, but I think one must keep these things in perspective.\"\n\n\"I have a lot of incredible memories, singular memories, that are shared among those four women, and I'm incredibly grateful for the experience,\" she continued. \"I forever love having had that time with those women.\"\n\nHear more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nSarah Jessica Parker Jokes Stephen Colbert Could 'Play Samantha' in \u2018Sex and the City 3\u2019\n\nSarah Jessica Parker Officially Nixes the Idea of 'Sex and the City 3' (Exclusive)\n\n'Sex and the City 3' Not Happening!

TMZ also posted footage recorded in October 2017 allegedly depicting Thompson kissing one woman while a different woman groped him at the Darna hookah lounge outside of Washington D.C.\n\nTristan Thompson and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian. Khloe Kardashian/Instagram\n\nDespite the allegations of infidelity \u2014 a source previously told PEOPLE that Thompson is \u201ca serial cheater\u201d \u2014 the insider says the mother-to-be is likely to stay with Thompson.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a hopeless romantic and she\u2019ll try to make this work. She tried forever to make it work with Lamar [Odom]. She\u2019s having a child with Tristan, and she\u2019s going to try to rebuild this,\u201d the source says.\n\nAdds the source: \u201cKhlo\u00e9 could probably convince herself to get over the fact that he maybe, kind of, sort of, hooked up with some groupie while out on the road. But being so indiscreet about it and letting it get splashed all over the place and having it humiliate her? That\u2019s actually even worse.\u201d\n\nPrior to meeting Thompson, Kardashian was in a nearly eight-year relationship with ex-husband Odom. They wed on Sept. 27, 2009 \u2014 one month to the day after they met (and nine days after getting engaged) \u2014 but the marriage fell apart after the former basketball player\u2019s cheating scandal and drug relapse, which led Kardashian to file for divorce in 2013.\n\nJAKE HOLLY/startraksphoto.com\n\nKhloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom\n\n\u201cKhlo\u00e9 spent so much time with Lamar just excusing away the obvious, turning a blind eye to what was so clearly happening, that it would be impossible for her not to feel like a fool if she made the same sort of mistakes again and just ignored that N.Y.C footage [of Thompson[. That\u2019s not the way a man deeply in love with the mother of his child behaves. It\u2019s just not. And Khlo\u00e9 can\u2019t lie to herself and tell herself otherwise,\u201d the source says.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Did Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2019s Boyfriend Get Too Close to Another Woman Right Before She Gives Birth?\n\n\u201cThe thing about Khlo\u00e9, though, is she\u2019s a big believer in knowing someone\u2019s back story and understanding how it motivates them. With Lamar, her heart broke for everything he\u2019d been through in the past, losing his mom and his grandma and his baby boy, and she used that as a justification for why he struggled so much with addiction and cheating. She\u2019s got a big heart \u2014 too big sometimes,\u201d the source shares.\n\nThompson and Kardashian began dating in September 2016, when his ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig was still pregnant with Thompson\u2019s first child, 16-month-old son Prince Oliver. Neither has addressed whether he met Kardashian while still in a relationship with Craig.\n\nWatch the full special Born Kardashian streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.\n\nDavid Livingston/Getty; Jordan Craig/Instagram\n\nTristan Thompson and Jordan Craig\n\n\u201cWith Tristan, she believed his back story that he was never even that committed to her or in love with Jordan, and that he\u2019d never meant to be with Jordan long-term,\u201d the insider explains.\u201dKhlo\u00e9 let herself believe that he\u2019s a really good guy with a good heart.

And if the fictional country's reigning leaders have anything to say about it, \"Princess Diaries 3\" will make it to the big screen.\n\nJulie Andrews, who played Mia's grandmother -- Queen Clarisse Renaldi, obviously -- told Buzzfeed that both she and Anne Hathaway would love to do a third installment of the franchise.\n\n\"There's talk about it,\" she said. \"And [Hathaway]'s very keen to do it. I would very willingly and happily do it.\"\n\nThe last the world heard such an update was in March 2016, when beloved director Garry Marshall told People that he, Andrews and Hathaway were actively discussing the exciting subject: \"I was with Anne Hathaway a few weeks ago,\" he said. \"It looks like we want to do 'Princess Diaries 3' in Manhattan.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Marshall unexpectedly passed away in July 2016 at age 81, and discussions, of course, paused indefinitely. But Andrews now confirms that she and Hathaway have had at least one conversation about it -- and it's pretty promising!\n\nPREMIERE\n\n\"I think we might do it in honor of him,\" she said of Marshall. \"Annie had an idea that she wanted to pursue about it, and I'm all for it, so if she'd like to...\"\n\nIf it moves forward, the film would be absent of another big name: Legendary singer Whitney Houston co-produced both the original film and its sequel. She died in February 2012.\n\nBut -- and this is mostly wishful thinking -- there could be a totally unexpected hero: None other than Shonda Rhimes wrote the screenplay for \"The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement.\" Come on, Shonda! Get on board for \"Princess Diaries 3\"!\n\nRELATED: See photos of Anne Hathaway through the years",

A Band-Aid mark on Kylie Jenner's arm was just barely visible as she posed with Selena Gomez at the Met Gala on Monday night and it soon went viral on Twitter\n\nThe mark, which looked like either a Band-Aid covered over with makeup or the remnants of a bandage, was just barely visible in the right lighting.\n\nThe mark, which looked like either a Band-Aid covered over with makeup or the remnants of a bandage, was just barely visible in the right lighting\n\nThe mysterious nature of the mark seemed to capture the imagination of many fans as they took to Twitter to discuss its meaning and origins.\n\nHad Kylie been injured? Was it a fashion statement? Or was it simply an unexplained phenomenon?\n\nFans were ultimately not so concerned with the meaning of the mark and instead thought it might just be a cool trend they could jump on.\n\nOne fan humorously wrote: 'I saw Kylie Jenner with a bandaid mark, so I got a bandaid mark (sic)'.\n\nMeanwhile, she welcomed her first child, baby daughter Stormi, just three months ago.\n\nAnd after shunning the limelight during her pregnancy, Kylie made her red carpet return on Monday night.\n\nThe reality star picked the most public arena possible for her big reveal, strutting alongside boyfriend Travis as she made her way into the Met Gala.\n\nOnline detectives: The mysterious nature of the mark seemed to capture the imagination of many fans as they took to Twitter to discuss its meaning and origins\n\nKylie Jenner's comeback!

It's fine!\" Mel B yelled immediately. \"It's fine.\"\n\nGuest host Ken Jeong comforted the concerned performers, explaining that, even though things didn't go flawlessly, it was clear how skilled they really are.\n\n\"This is not America's Got Perfection, it's America's Got Talent!\" Jeong shared. \"Nobody can do this. I mean, it's OK!\"\n\n\"I don't think there's ever been a singer on any of our competitions who's been note-perfect,\" Simon Cowell said, reiterating Jeong's remarks. \"It doesn't make them not amazing, it makes them human.\"\n\n\"Although the consequences of this are slightly worse than falling off-key, whereas you nearly broke your neck,\" Cowell added. \"And the fact that you're nearly blind makes this incredible.\"\n\nWhile the pair were understandably concerned that their mishap could spell the end of their AGT journey, they were overwhelmed when they were told they'd be moving on to the live rounds at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood.\n\n\"It means so much to us,\" Mary said through tears. \"It's been such a long road to get here, and to be through to the live shows means we're one step closer to the dream.\"\n\nAmerica's Got Talent returns for its second night of Judge Cuts next Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET/PT on NBC.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\n'America's Got Talent': Goth Comedian Brought to Tears When All the Judges Love His Set\n\nInspiring Young 'America's Got Talent' Singer Dishes on Getting Golden Buzzer From Mel B (Exclusive)\n\n'America's Got Talent': Simon Cowell Promises to Buy Young Contestant a Dog After He Nails Audition\n\nRelated Articles:",

We look forward to introducing adult moviegoers to our adorably unapologetic characters this summer,\u201d his statement continued.\n\nSTX Productions\n\nIn their complaint, the Sesame Street creators say their show has spent 50 years building its \u201creputation for wholesome educational programming,\u201d while the trailer for the new film depicts \u201cexplicit, profane, drug-using, misogynistic, violent, copulating, and even ejaculating puppets.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaint, the film\u2019s explicit content \u201cdiluted and defiled Sesame\u2019s beloved Sesame Street children\u2019s television show.\u201d\n\nWARNING: TRAILER CONTAINS EXPLICIT CONTENT\n\nThe film\u2019s logline describes the movie as \u201ca filthy comedy set in the underbelly of Los Angeles where puppets and humans coexist.\u201d McCarthy stars as a detective who teams up with a puppet private eye to track down a serial killer. In addition to being directed by Henson\u2019s son, the film was produced by The Jim Henson Company\u2019s Henson Alternative banner, On The Day Productions, and was executive produced by Henson\u2019s daughter Lisa Henson.\n\nThe movie has earned substantial buzz, with the R-rated trailer wracking up nearly 1.7 million views on YouTube.\n\nDespite describing the film as \u201cindescribably crude,\u201d the complaint makes clear that Sesame Street is not trying to stop the movie from hitting theaters. \u201cIt is only [the filmmaker\u2019s] deliberate choice to invoke and commercially misappropriate Sesame\u2019s name and goodwill in marketing the movie \u2013 and thereby cause consumers to conclude that Sesame is somehow associated with the movie \u2013 that has infringed on and tarnished the Sesame Street mark and goodwill.\u201d\n\nThe show\u2019s creators are asking that the filmpull its advertising, in addition to unspecified damages.\n\nThe Happytime Murders, also starring Joel McHale and Elizabeth Banks, is set to hit theaters Aug. 17.",

She stepped onto the red carpet in a La Perla Haute Couture Collection gown designed by Creative Director Julia Haart that was made but nothing but 85,000 hand painted and placed crystals. Basically, it's the chicest net you'll ever see walk the red carpet.\n\nJenner kept the rest of the look simple. Because when you're wearing nothing but accessories, you don't need to wear any.

Joe \u2014 who's lived in the affluent area, along with wife Cynthia, for 35 years and also owns and runs Joanne Trattoria eatery there \u2014 spoke to the New York Post to explain his stance.\n\nAs he tells it in a story published on Aug. 9, the problems started six weeks earlier when NYC turned the Stratford Arms Hotel \u2014 which had been a residence hall for the American Musical and Dramatic Academy and is just down the block from Joe's home \u2014 into a shelter for 500 migrants. \"It was a stealth operation. They were bused in the middle of the night, like when they flew them into Westchester, they didn't want anybody to know what was going on,\" he shared. \"It was all pretty rapid.\"\n\nHe said that the migrants have been throwing block parties outside their hotel that run into the early morning hours, that people are recklessly riding e-bikes and scooters on one-way streets and that evidence of prostitution has emerged. Girls as young as 14 are getting catcalled and residents are dealing with verbal abuse too, he alleged. There's also trash piling up on what used to be clean streets. It's all causing property values to drop and leaving residents feeling helpless, Joe explained. \"They're guests in our neighborhood and they have basically taken over,\" he said.\n\nJoe Schildhorn/BFA/Shutterstock\n\n\"Hookers are coming and going. In the mornings, you see prostitutes coming out of the building,\" he said, adding that \"the worst part's at night\" because of \"the noise,\" which \"starts at about 10 o'clock\" and goes \"until 4 in the morning.\" Joe also said they're \"playing music and racing their motocross and motorbikes up and down the streets.\"\n\nIf things were like this when Joe was raising his daughters \u2014 Lady Gaga (real name: Stefani Germanotta) and Natali Germanotta \u2014 \"I wouldn't be living in New York,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the businessman, \"The dormitory students at the school, the American Music and Dance Academy, were given two weeks' notice that they had to get out, and none of the residents in the neighborhood were given any notice about the migrant shelter.\" He believes that about 500 migrants are living in 400 rooms that are only large enough for a bed and refrigerator and that everyone is sharing bathrooms \u2014 a typical college dorm setup.\n\nDonna Ward/Getty Images\n\nJoe made it clear that his issue is not that the migrants are in his neighborhood. It's that the city isn't dealing with the issues that have emerged nor is there a plan to restore order, he claimed. \"I think, for the most part, the 500 that are in there are good people,\" Joe explained. \"And I think they're locked into very small rooms and when they get out, they go out at night, and they party.\"\n\nHe added, \"I don't mind having them there. They're gonna be there for three years. That was the contract, I understand. But at least manage it. Put the proper security in place, have a police presence and a code of conduct.\"\n\nJoe is the board president of his building and, along with other neighboring residences, is lobbying City Hall for better policing and supervision while the migrants are there. He also has some advice for NYC's mayor: \"In my opinion, you should have just suspended 'sanctuary city' status until we had enough housing and then said, 'Yeah, OK, you can send some more,'\" Joe told the Post. \"It's a joke. Why doesn't he get one of the cruise ships? The cruise ships hold more people, and it's a more controlled environment. The city is spending a tremendous amount of money that could be spent towards building affordable housing.\"\n\n",

Great potential!'\n\nAmongst the complimentary references to the teenager's voice, another simply added: 'Next Justin Bieber.'\n\nHere they come: The compliments flooded in on Monday morning, with the Bieber comparison proving to be a recurring theme\n\nPassionate: Cruz has made no secret of his love of music and has already released one single, the festive charity track If Every Day Was Christmas, in 2016\n\nHigh praise: Many fans praised the teenager on his 'amazing' singing ability\n\nCruz previously won praise after sharing a clip of himself singing Charlie Puth hit One Call Away in 2017.\n\nBut the teenager's passion for music came under scrutiny as fans branded David and Victoria as 'pushy parents' following the release of his debut single, despite the track being released for charity.\n\nWhile he was clearly keen on following in his former Spice Girl mother's footsteps, David, 43, insisted that they didn't force him to embark on a music career - insisting that it was all Cruz's idea.\n\nOld friends: Captioning the brief video, Victoria, 44, suggested the song may well be another collaboration with acclaimed songwriter and producer Rodney Jerkins, with whom Cruz worked on the festive single\n\nFirm favourite: Cruz is thought to be a fan of Canadian pop star Bieber (pictured with the singer at the Teen Choice Awards in 2011)\n\n'Cruz came for us very recently and said, \"How about I do a Christmas song and all the proceeds go to charity?\"' former Manchester united and England midfielder David told Good Morning America at the time.\n\n'There\u2019s nothing more to this than that at the moment. He\u2019s 11-years-old, he\u2019s still at school, he\u2019s still concentrating at school, that\u2019s the most important thing but he wanted to give back.'\n\nHe added: 'He\u2019s done this amazing little Christmas song which has got a lot of attention and we\u2019re very proud of him because he came to us with the idea. It\u2019s kinda cool and he\u2019s having fun.'\n\nAt the time the youngster also signed to Bieber's manager Scooter Braun, who was said to be close friends with Victoria and David.",

        "content": "Dior was so close to doing a great thing, but then fumbled at the last minute. For the label\u2019s Cruise 2019 collection, designer Maria Grazia Chiuri based her collection on the beautiful clothing worn by Mexican Escaramuza Charra riders. However, Chirui\u2019s inspiration fell flat when her clothing appeared on Dior\u2019s face, Jennifer Lawrence. Now, both Dior and Lawrence are being accused of cultural appropriation.\n\nEscaramuza is a traditional Mexican sport that is comprised of 10 to 16 women on horseback doing choreographed dancing and stunts to Mexican music. The sport first began at the birth of the Mexican revolution, during which women were allowed to participate and appear at the front of the battle in their traditional dress.\n\nThe wardrobe of the Escaramuza is as beautiful and precise as their routines, and an Escaramuza team must adhere to strict guidelines when crafting their uniform. Frills, shawls, ornaments, boots, and hats are all musts, and give fashion labels like Dior a lot to drool over.\n\nHowever, by putting Jennifer Lawrence \u2014 who is neither Mexican nor Latina \u2014 in clothing inspired by such culturally important dress for Mexican women has many questioning whether or not Dior cares about the cultural significance of the Escaramuza at all.\n\n[fm_instagram url=\u201dhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BpWT84DFdZN/\u201d]\n\nLawrence said in a behind-the-scenes clip from the photoshoot featured on Dior\u2019s Instagram, \u201cOne of the main inspirations of this collection is the traditional women riders of Mexico. I\u2019m really excited that this collection is looking at and celebrating these women\u2019s heritage through such a modern lens.\u201d\n\n[fm_instagram url=\u201dhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BpY5AffFrCc/\u201d]\n\nMany fault Dior for lacking the wherewithal to cast a Mexican model as the face of the collection. Although Lawrence should have seen through the culturally appropriative problem, it\u2019s more disappointing that Dior is just that oblivious.\n\n[fm_twitter url=\u201dhttps://twitter.com/indigogurt/status/1062502805657804801\u2033]\n\n[fm_twitter url=\u201dhttps://twitter.com/margotwoll/status/1062454441444589568\u2033]\n\n[fm_twitter url=\u201dhttps://twitter.com/HotNewHipHop/status/1062812415912525824\u2033]\n\n[fm_twitter url=\u201dhttps://twitter.com/WriteHarpSing/status/1062451329413603330\u2033]\n\nDior did feature a team of Escaramuza, wearing uniforms from Chirui\u2019s collection, in the the label\u2019s Cruise 2019 fashion show. However, the models presenting the inspired clothing on the runway were primarily white. It\u2019s a bit boggling how Dior completely missed the mark.\n\n[fm_youtube url=\u201dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whY-5h4w6Ok\u201d]\n\nThis cultural appropriation slip up is an obvious reminder that the fashion industry still has a long road ahead of them in terms of diversification and inclusion. Labels must become more aware of the impact they have on culture and society, and do more to make formative statements with their collections.",

NBC chairman Andy Lack just signed Megyn Kelly to a major deal, and now the New York Post reports that there are rumors at the Peacock Network that the former Fox News star could take over for Savannah Guthrie on the Today show.\n\nThough Kelly had taken pitches from ABC and CNN after leaving FOX, the promise of a daytime slot and a Sunday night show at NBC was too much for her to pass up. However, there may not be much to the Today rumors \u2014 NBC insists that Guthrie, who is currently on maternity leave and recently signed a five-year deal with Today, isn\u2019t going anywhere.\n\n\u201cWe just signed Savannah to a massive deal that is longer than Megyn\u2019s,\u201d a high-level NBC source told Page Six. \u201cA lead anchor role at Today isn\u2019t part of the conversation for Megyn. The goal was simply to get someone of Megyn\u2019s talent and caliber through the door at NBC. We have not made a decision on her daytime slot. It is being discussed.\u201d\n\nIt was rumored that Kelly was in deep talks with ABC to replace Robin Roberts on Good Morning America, though network officials have denied any such reports.\n\nKelly, who was FOX\u2019s No. 2 anchor for some time behind Bill O\u2019Reilly, announced earlier this month that she would be leaving the network for NBC News. Her decision comes after Greta Van Susteren also departed FOX last fall in favor of MSNBC, leaving the network without its top two female anchors. Mediaite claimed that FOX had offered Kelly as much as $100 million to remain, though it seems money did not sway her final decision. She will be replaced by The Daily Caller founder Tucker Carlson.\n\nAlso on FORBES:\n\n\u201cI have grown up here and been given every chance a young reporter could ever ask for,\u201d she said while praising Rupert Murdoch and the FOX family.\n\nKelly spent 12 years with FOX, quickly climbing up the ranks and becoming a nationally recognized brand. President-elect Trump\u2019s attacks on her during the election cycle helped raise her profile even more. However, a possible Today gig is a far different animal than the 9 p.m. slot Kelly is used to, with audiences typically favoring entertainment stories and lighter subject matter as opposed to her traditional hard news.\n\nWill Carlson, who has had an up-and-down career in front of the cameras, be an effective replacement at FOX? Will NBC push Guthrie out on Today in favor of Kelly? The answers to both questions will have far reaching impacts for their respective networks.\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nIf you like what you're reading, follow @Great_Katzby on Twitter.",

Unlike them, C\u00e9line Dion loves the Met Gala. She adores the Met Gala. Monday night marked her first time at the event, and she made sure to make it count.\n\nWearing a bespoke Versace gown and Bulgari jewels, Dion maintained a level of wide-eyed energy and excitement from the moment she hit the carpet, and she never let it falter. While speaking to a reporter for Entertainment Tonight, she took up the woman\u2019s request to crown her with no questions asked, saying \u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d She proceeded to belt out Sia\u2019s \u201cFreeze You Out\u201d while laying the headpiece on top of the woman\u2019s head.\n\nShe shared with E! that she insisted her gown have a deep pocket to hold her invitation, a tissue, her driver's license, and passport in case no one at the door recognized her. Though if they tried to turn her away, she guaranteed that she\u2019d \u201cstart singing in the middle of the street\u201d to prove her identity.",

This is a common claim that has been reported in various media outlets, so it's likely to be true (1).\n\nThe message then states that C\u00e9line Dion loves the Met Gala, which seems unusual given the negative experiences of other celebrities mentioned earlier. However, this could be a genuine expression of her enthusiasm for the event.\n\nSome details in the message seem suspicious or unlikely, such as Dion insisting on having a deep pocket in her gown to carry various items, including her driver's license and passport. This sounds like an unusual requirement, especially given the high level of security at the Met Gala.\n\nAdditionally, the claim that Dion would start singing in the middle of the street if she were turned away is also unlikely, as it's not a typical behavior for someone trying to prove their identity.\n\nConsidering these points, I predict that this message has some elements that are likely true (e.g., C\u00e9line Dion attending the Met Gala) but others that are exaggerated or fabricated (e.g., her unusual requirements and song performance). Therefore, I'm inclined to believe that the veracity of this message is around 0.5-0.6, leaning slightly towards being a real message with some embellishments.\n\n1",

If she wins the primary and then the election on Nov. 6, Nixon would be the first woman and openly gay person to hold the position.\n\nWhile it\u2019s still too soon to know the fate of Nixon\u2019s gubernatorial run, here\u2019s a look back at all the warm endorsements Nixon has received from her fellow Sex and the City alums.\n\nEverett\n\nSarah Jessica Parker\n\nSarah Jessica Parker, whose friendship with Nixon predates the beloved HBO series, revealed in April that she knew about Nixon\u2019s plans to run for office before the official announcement.\n\n\u201cShe shared with me that she was going to announce about a month before.

I know she would be an excellent Governor !\u201d wrote Davis, 53, who played Charlotte on the hit HBO series.\n\nDimitrios Kambouris/VF1/WireImage\n\nDavis then shared that she had already donated to Nixon\u2019s campaign, and urged her followers to do the same.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to support someone I have know [sic] for 20 years to be one of the most intelligent and caring people in my life,\u201d Davis added.\n\nWillie Garson\n\nSupport for Nixon wasn\u2019t limited to her female costars!\n\nWillie Garson, 54 \u2014 who played Parker\u2019s friend Stanford Blatch \u2014 was also quick to endorse her.\n\n\u201cI cant think of anyone who\u2019s more prepared, more caring, more educated on the issues and more READY than @cynthiaenixon\u2026.please join her on this journey, together we can turn things around with candidates such as her,\u201d he wrote alongside a clip of her campaign video.",

Ever since his friendship with Neri went public, she\u2019s been doubting their relationship and wondering whether he is serious about building a new life with her.\n\n\u2018Brad is desperately trying to convince Jen that they\u2019re just friends and that he\u2019s committed but Jen just isn\u2019t buying it.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s very wary of him \u2013 after all, it feels like only yesterday that he cheated on her with Angelina and destroyed their marriage.\n\n\u2018While Jen is hopeful that she and Brad will work things out, she\u2019s also preparing herself for the fact that she may have to raise this baby alone. She has always said that she would be happy to be a single mother if that\u2019s how everything worked out,\u2019 reveals the insider.\n\nAfter her split from Justin earlier, People magazine reported that having kids was always part of her plan during their marriage.\n\n\u2018She had been sad it never happened,\u2019 a source told the magazine. \u2018But it never consumed her.\u2019\n\nBut since their separation, Jen has realised that her window for having a child is closing fast, making this baby buzz a beautiful surprise.\n\n\u2018This could be a dream come true for her, and she\u2019s not going to let troubles with Brad ruin it. If she winds up alone, that\u2019s absolutely fine with her. All she wants is a baby.\u2019\n\nOver the years, Jen has always dreamed of having a child, so the pregnancy is clearly everything to her.\n\nIn the past, she has lashed out at suggestions that she chose her Hollywood career over becoming a mum: \u2018This continually is said about me: that I was so career-driven and focused on myself; that I don\u2019t want to be a mother and how selfish that is,\u2019 she told Allure.\n\nDenying that was the case, she said: \u2018No. Even saying it gets me a little tight in my throat.\u2019\n\nFor the full story, and to see more exclusive pictures of Jen's baby bump, see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!",

If your friend's husband has been accused of cheating, would you go to the press or around town or wherever and announce that said husband has, in fact, flirted with you, too? OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T, because you're a decent human being who doesn't kick your friends in the fucking shins when they're down. But when a certain former Real Housewife of New York City fame-lover sees a chance for press, she goes for the jugular. After reports surfaced that said Ramona Singer's husband funded the abortion of one of his mistresses, a \"friend\" of Ramona's has decided to add fuel to the fire. Jill Zarin says Mario Singer flirted with her until Bobby Zarin intervened and asked him to stop.\n\nJill literally gave an interview in which the sole purpose was to throw her friend under the bus. She told In Touch, \"When we were taping the show, Mario hit on me. It made me uncomfortable to the point where I had to tell [my husband] Bobby to tell Mario to leave me alone.\"\n\nBut wait, the under bus throwing gets worse.\n\n\u201cHe was always looking around,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople would talk about it, but nobody would ever say anything because they didn\u2019t want to hurt Ramona. They felt bad for her.\u201d\n\nThen, just when you thought it couldn't get any more two-faced, she tells the magazine:\n\nRamona and I lived through an incredible experience together, so of course I will support her any way I can. Mario flirted with me as I saw him flirt with many other girls. The best thing for her to do is to stand tall and move on.\n\nDo you see how that first sentence doesn't add up with the ones that follow? YOU CAN'T BE SUPPORTIVE AND THEN TELL A MAGAZINE THAT MARIO FLIRTED WITH YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE. Obviously, this really gets to me.\n\nListen, I'm not apologizing for Mario and I don't even find Ramona to be that sympathetic. It's just... ugh, Jill. She's the worst. No wonder she was kicked off the show \u2014 that mean streak is just too much. Even for Bravo.",

Paul Getty.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nIf you look in the right spot, you can see a single shot of Kevin Spacey in \"All the Money in the World\" that made the final version of the movie.\n\nDirector Ridley Scott reshot all of Spacey's scenes with Christopher Plummer following the actor's sexual misconduct allegations, but there's one wide shot he couldn't reshoot.\n\nIt's a flashback scene where Getty gets off a train in the desert.

It then cuts to a closeup shot of Plummer as Getty in the white suit with a background make it look like he's in the desert, thanks to green screen. The wide shot was clearly filmed on location, so it makes sense that Scott would have to keep that Spacey shot as he had no time (and the logistics would have been a nightmare) to fly back to that location and reshoot it with Plummer.\n\nChristopher Plummer in \"All the Money in the World.\" Sony\n\nScott confirmed, according to numerous reports, that it is Spacey in that wide shot and that he was unable to reshoot it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the rest of the Getty scenes in the movie are clearly of Plummer, which Scott could pull off as they are mostly scenes shot in one exterior location or interiors, which could all have been filmed on studio sets. And in the case of the desert scenes, Plummer shot the close ups with the help of a green screen.\n\nThe Spacey shot in the desert is a quick one, but keep and eye out for it when you see the movie.\n\nRead our full review of \"All the Money in the World\" here.",

She concluded the performance by lying backward onto the fluffy instrument.\n\nBe sure to check out PEOPLE\u2019s full Grammys coverage to get the latest news on music\u2019s big night.\n\nJust hours before the show, Gaga shared a touching message on social media about how she was hoping to transform the \u201cdeep grief\u201d that inspired Joanne into \u201chope and healing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have carried a deep grief in my heart over my family\u2019s tragedy,\u201d she wrote, referring to her late aunt, Joanne Stefani Germanotta, who died of lupus complications at age 19.\n\n\u201cThe loss of Joanne affected my father so deeply that it affected me. When he cried, I cried. When he was angry, I was angry. When he was hurt, I hurt,\u201d she continued.\n\nTo donate to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which will provide subsidized legal support to women and men in all industries who have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or abuse in the workplace, visit its GoFundMe page.

After 10 years with you I still get nervous before the Grammys, but I know I have an angel with me.\u201d\n\nGaga, who is nominated for best pop solo performance and best pop vocal album in addition to taking the stage, had previously shared how \u201chonored\u201d she felt to be performing from her deeply personal album at the award show.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so honored to be singing from #Joanne,\u201d she wrote on Saturday, adding, \u201cThis album and moment with [my] little monsters means so much to me.\u201d\n\nThough the pop star was born nearly 12 years after Joanne\u2019s death, she remains one of Gaga\u2019s biggest influences.\n\n\u201cWhen Mark and I wrote it, the decision to name the album that was in tribute to my father\u2019s sister who died when she was 19,\u201d she told Beats 1\u2019s Zane Lowe of her poet/painter aunt in September 2016, one month before her album\u2019s release.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Here\u2019s the List of Nominees for the 2018 Grammy Awards\n\nShe went on to reveal that the album encompassed \u201ceverything about Joanne, which also happens to be my middle name.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all the toughness of the pain of losing her that made us all strong and made us who we are,\u201d Gaga added. \u201cShe is the woman of my past who is becoming and helping me bring more of my honest woman self into the future.\u201d\n\nThe singer, 31, was among the first celebrities to arrive on the red carpet at Madison Square Garden, and she was a standout in a custom Armani Priv\u00e9 black lace, long-sleeved jumpsuit, plus a dramatic black skirt with a high leg slit and statement train that according to eye-witnesses on the carpet, required three people to carry.\n\nJamie McCarthy/Getty\n\nThe singer accessorized her look with statement danglers and an engagement-like pink diamond ring (surrounded by a halo of smaller white diamonds on a gold band) that she\u2019s been seen wearing for the last few months.

I'm not myself anymore. I\u2019m just too nervous\".'\n\nThe 36-year-old sports star - who had welcomed her first child with Reddit co-founder Ohanian just two months before their wedding - managed to remain calm and sympathetic.\n\nShe wrote back and said: 'Daddy, it's okay, if you don't want to come to the wedding at all, that's okay too. I'm not going to be upset with you about it, so I don't want you to be upset about it.'\n\nGetty Images\n\nSerena added that while Richard's health is better now, at the time he wasn't feeling good about himself, and although many daughters may have reacted differently, all she wanted was for her family to be happy.\n\n'Maybe a lot of daughters wouldn't react the same way, but I know the struggles he\u2019s had these last few years,' she reflected.\n\nGetty Images\n\n'His health is better now, but I know he still doesn\u2019t feel like himself, doesn\u2019t feel like he's perfect. And if he doesn\u2019t want to be up there in front of a lot of people, I completely understand.\n\n'Look, when we first came on the scene, there were a lot of people who didn\u2019t get him. I don\u2019t think a lot of them wanted to get him.\n\nGetty Images\n\n'I don\u2019t think a lot of him could have anyway. Our family knows what we have. We just want each other to be happy. That's what matters. I don\u2019t think anything could ever change that.'\n\nSerena - the greatest female athlete in the world - walked down the aisle by herself, with her daughter Alexis looking on from the front row.\n\nBeing Serena chronicles the star's pregnancy, difficult birth, marriage to Ohanian, and her successful return to tennis.\n\nMeanwhile, Serena is believed to be attending Meghan's wedding to Prince Harry this weekend in Windsor.\n\nThe royal wedding has been marred by family drama. It was recently reported that former lighting director wouldn't be able to attend as he had to undergo a heart procedure this week.\n\nMeghan Markle has now confirmed that her father won't be attending the ceremony, but he had previously said he would be there to walk his daughter down the aisle - health permitting.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe furore began when it was alleged that Thomas had staged recent paparazzi photos, which had left him feeling 'deeply embarrassed'. However, certain press outlets had been writing disparaging articles about him and his Mexico home, and it appeared as though he had been harassed by photographers.\n\nIn his absence, it's believed Meghan's mother Doria Ragland will walk Meghan down the aisle, which royal expert Penny Junor said would be 'enormously touching'.\n\nIt would also be a nice gesture towards gender equality, with Meghan being a vocal feminist and women's rights advocate.\n\nOur thoughts go out to the Markles and the Royal Family during this difficult time.",

In perhaps an even more surprising passage of time, it\u2019s been nearly five years since Cruise and Holmes announced their split in June 2012 when their daughter, Suri, was just six years old. The divorce was surrounded by rumors and reports, namely involving Cruise\u2019s involvement in Scientology. In a new interview with Town & Country, Holmes made a vague reference to how the rumor mill still affects her and her daughter\u2019s lives\u2014or doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s world a lot of celebrities probably shield their children from the tabloids; in my household we know what they print isn\u2018t true, so we don\u2019t pay attention,\u201d she said.\n\nThis quote begs the question of just how much Holmes, who has primary custody of her daughter, lets Suri see or read when it comes to tabloid mentions (especially involving the two of them).\n\nIn a clear effort for privacy, the actress and director has been careful to keep her only child out of the public eye. Suri makes rare appearances on Holmes\u2019s social-media accounts, mostly for occasions like a family birthday party last September and her mother\u2019s birthday in December.\n\nIn her Town & Country interview, Holmes said she knows she cannot control the fact that her name will be tabloid fodder.\n\n\u201cThere are more important things,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut it\u2019s very relatable to me; if people know who you are, they might write about you, and you can't control that.\u201d\n\nThroughout the piece Holmes remained coy about just how private she keeps her daughter\u2018s life. But she was direct about one thing in particular: her main focus is for Suri, who will be 11 in April, to maintain her childlike innocence as long as possible.\n\n\u201cMy child is the most important person to me, and her upbringing is paramount to my work right now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that I\u2019m present and she has a stable, innocent childhood.

Animal lover Robert Pattinson reveals how his rescue dog became a pampered pooch overnight\n\nThere are many reasons to be a fan of Robert Pattinson, but just in case there are people who still need swaying, he has provided another.\n\nThe Twilight star showed how much of an animal lover he is during an interview on the Ellen DeGeneres which is set to air on Friday.\n\nThe 26-year-old chatted about his rescue dog Bear to host Ellen \u2013 who is also a huge supporter of animal rescue.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nAnimal lover: Robert Pattinson chatted about his rescue dog Bear when he and Taylor Lautner (L) were interviewed by Ellen DeGeneres\n\nRobert revealed that he saved Bear, who was five weeks old at the time, from a kill shelter in Louisiana the day before he was about to be euthanized.\n\nAnd Bear\u2019s life changed in an instant as he went straight from the shelter and onto a private jet to Los Angeles \u2013 which Robert revealed is not his \u2018way of usual travelling\u2019.\n\nOnce he landed, Bear was tucking into some fancy meats that he was given by his doting new owner, and Robert joked that he had actually turned into a Hollywood diva dog by accident.\n\nDiva dog: The Twilight star revealed that he accidentally spoiled the dog after saving him from a kill shelter\n\nLiving the dream: When he arrived at the Four Seasons in Los Angeles Bear was fed prosciutto instead of dog food\n\nHe said: \u2018We were staying at the Four Seasons afterwards. He didn't have any dog food so I got him a little plate of prosciutto.\u2019\n\nR-Pattz and Taylor Lautner, who was interviewed alongside him, laughed with Ellen about Bear\u2019s unusually long tongue.\n\nEllen described the pooch as \u2018like a Gene Simmons dog\u2019 and Robert added: \u2018It\u2019s like a curtain.\u2019\n\nRobert admitted he thought that adorable Bear would keep on growing, but that never happened.\n\n'It's like a curtain': The actor joked with Ellen about the huge size of his pooch's tongue\n\nSmitten: Even Taylor admits that he is 'obsessed' with the adorable dog, who R-Pattz shares with Kristen Stewart\n\nHe said: \u2018He was supposed to be a big man's dog, but he just kind of got stunted.\u2019\n\nHowever Bear still gets a huge amount of love and affection from Robert and Kristen Stewart, who he shares her with.\n\nEven Taylor is smitten with the pup, and confessed during the interview that he is \u2018obsessed\u2019.\n\nMeanwhile, Kristen has adopted another dog named Bernie, who is a friend to Bear.\n\nJust in time: Robert saved a then five-week-old Bear from a kill shelter just one day before he was about to be euthanized\n\nThe actress said during an interview on Wednesday that she has an 'obsession with rescuing the pooches'.\n\nRobert was much more comfortable chatting about his dog with Ellen than he was during an interview on The Today Show on Wednesday, where he deflected questions about whether or not he and Kristen are back together\n\nThe cast are currently promoting the final instalment of Twilight \u2013 Breaking Dawn: Part II, which hits cinemas November 16.",

Since then, Jackson said, she\u2019s stayed involved in the issue and has visited prisons to learn more.\n\nIn her tweet, Kardashian said, \"it started with Ms. Alice, but looking at her and seeing the faces and learning the stories of the men and women I\u2019ve met inside prisons I knew I couldn\u2019t stop at just one.\"\n\nAlso attending the meeting: Presidential adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump, whose focus in the White House has been on building job skills.\n\n\u201cI think this is one thing that set today's conversation apart,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in not just granting clemency, but making sure those who are granted clemency succeed when they come home.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Kardashian went to the White House to lobby for a pardon for Alice Marie Johnson; Trump eventually granted clemency to Johnson, a 63-year-old woman who spent more than two decades in prison on drug charges.\n\nMore:'It\u2019s so unfair': Kim Kardashian working to free another convicted felon serving life\n\nTMZ, which first reported Kardashian's latest White House trip, said she is seeking a pardon or clemency for Chris Young, who is serving life in a Tennessee prison for cocaine and marijuana possession.",

She attended school in the southern part of California. Soon after she was done with her college, she joined the real estate scene where she met her co-host, ex-husband and husband, who is none other than Tarek El Moussa. As of 2018, Christina El Moussa\u2019s net worth is $4 million.\n\nSoon, the couple opened their own real estate agency: Tarek and Christina: The El Moussa Group. After their split, the agency is now Tarek and Associates with only Tarek El Moussa involved in it. Their real estate business began to suffer losses when the real estate market crashed in October 2008. This affected their lifestyle, as they progressively moved from a $6000 house to a $700 apartment complex.\n\nTheir lives changed when a friend of the couple helped them film the process of flipping a house from the start to finish. They sent it to various production houses, but not many people thought that the viewers wouldn\u2019t be interested in the video. The Pie Town Productions differently, liked the video that they had made. Then HGTV\u2019s producers noticed the Instagram profiles of the real estate couple. They found it very interesting because the profile featured many images of house before and after renovation.\n\nThe El Moussa couple\u2019s lives changed after HGTV, in 2012 signed them up for a weekly show that basically showed the process of buying a distressed property and then renovating it right until the finishing touches.

But since the news of her first pregnancy broke, the 20-year-old has been notoriously selective with sharing photos of herself, likely due to her desire to keep the pregnancy private.\n\nJenner is now slowly opening up about her experience. During a recent Q&A session with fans on Twitter, the makeup mogul revealed that she gained 40 pounds while carrying her daughter, Stormi. She quickly deleted the tweet.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nKylie Jenner gave birth to her first child, daughter Stormi, in early February.\n\nWhile answering fan questions on Twitter, Jenner revealed that she gained 40 pounds during pregnancy. She quickly deleted the tweet.\n\nAccording to gynecologist Dr. Kecia Gaither, 40 pounds is at the high end of a healthy weight gain for underweight pregnant women.\n\nJenner also revealed her biggest pregnancy cravings, including Eggo waffles and sushi.\n\nThe face-palm emoji was a nice touch. @kyliejenner/Twitter\n\nJenner was previously seen discussing her weight in her viral pregnancy announcement video, in which her doctor seemed to advise 28-35 pounds as an average total weight gain, noting that Jenner had gained 20 pounds at that time.\n\n\"Yeah, so, eight more pounds,\" the reality star replies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenner's doctor also advised her to engage in more cardio. Kylie Jenner/YouTube\n\nRecommended weight gain for pregnant women is based on each person's body and individual needs.\n\nThe average amount of weight a woman should gain during pregnancy ranges from 25 to 40 pounds, according to gynecologist Dr. Kecia Gaither.\n\n\"The question of weight gain in pregnancy is often a point of controversy,\" Gaither told INSIDER. \"But in general, health providers advise weight gain based on the patient's body weight at the start of pregnancy.\"\n\nGenerally speaking, Gaither said most women will fall into one of these pre-pregnancy weight categories and will be advised to gain weight according to their body:\n\nUnderweight: 28 to 40 pounds\n\nNormal weight: 25 to 35 pounds\n\nOverweight: 15 to 20 pounds\n\nObese: 10 to 15 pounds\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly around one-third of pregnant women (32%) gain weight within those recommended guidelines, according to the Center for Disease Control, which noted that recent studies found that 21% had gained too little weight, and 48% had gained too much.\n\nWhile Jenner's 40-pound weight gain is technically within those general parameters, fan reactions ranged from awe to disbelief.\n\nAlthough Jenner's sister Kim Kardashian West was very open about (and cruelly mocked for) her struggles with weight gain during pregnancy, the Kylie Cosmetics creator largely shielded her pregnant body from the public eye.\n\nJust over a month after giving birth, however, the new mom has been posting social media updates where she shows off her stomach. Of course, they sparked a response on social media.\n\nAlthough Jenner has not commented on her post-pregnancy diet or workout routine, according to What to Expect, if a woman gains at least 35 pounds during pregnancy, it generally takes between 10 months and two years to return to her previous weight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Jenner did lose 40 pounds in one month, two experts said that could be unsafe \u2014 or even impossible.\n\n\"Losing more than 10% of your initial body weight in one month is likely not a good idea,\" Dr. Caroline Apovian, director of the Nutrition and Weight Management Center at Boston Medical Center, told INSIDER.\n\nAlthough health recommendations always vary based on each person's body, Apovian said that \"average safe weight loss\" is generally considered to be one to two pounds per month.\n\nDietitian Andy Bellatti told INSIDER that barring special circumstances, like bariatric surgery, losing more than 10 pounds in a month would give him pause \u2014 and that 40 pounds would likely be impossible.\n\n\"Even with pregnancy, you could see 40 pounds lost, but that would be two or three months after birth,\" Bellatti told INSIDER.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's important to keep in mind, however, that it's unclear exactly how much weight Jenner has lost.\n\nBefore & after having a baby looking better than ever! A post shared by Kylie Jenner (@kyliesnapchat) on Mar 3, 2018 at 7:43am PST Mar 3, 2018 at 7:43am PST\n\nAdditionally, depending on the size of the baby and the weight of the woman's amniotic fluid and placenta (which are delivered at birth), most pregnant women can lose up to 12 pounds during delivery, according to What to Expect.\n\nSome fans did jump to Jenner's defense. One pointed out the difference between losing weight and losing baby weight. After all, Jenner did not gain 40 pounds of pure fat \u2014 she had a little human growing inside of her.\n\nFor her part, Jenner described her pregnancy as \" a perfect experience.\"\n\nIn fact, she revealed that the toughest part was not being able to eat sushi. She told another fan that her biggest craving during her pregnancy were Eggo waffles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I never liked them before I was pregnant and haven't had one since I had her\u2026 So strange!\" Jenner wrote.\n\nJenner had previously revealed her undying love for In-N-Out burgers \u2014 which she chose to eat against her doctor's orders. When a fan pointed this out, the \"Life of Kylie\" star added donuts to her list of indulgences.\n\nWe're glad Jenner is feeling more comfortable opening up to her fans \u2014 and we hope for more honest discussions about pregnancy and motherhood in the future.\n\nSign up here to get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox.",

Meg is accompanied by the three female guides, Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon), Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling) and Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey).\n\nViewers get a glimpse of the extraordinary costumes and visual effects that make this film so magical.

With these women, I wondered, could we make them women of different ages, body types, races? Could we bring in culture, bring in history in their costumes?

The book, which has a female heroine and three female supporting characters was a rarity in the 60\u2019s. L\u2019Engle\u2019s novel was shut down by many major publishing companies, because she thought too far outside of the box.\n\n\u201cSo WRINKLE, when it was finally published in 1962, after two years of rejections, broke several current taboos. The protagonist was female, and one of the unwritten rules of science fiction was that the protagonist should be male. I'm a female. Why would I give all the best ideas to a male?,\" L'Engle said in an acceptance speech for The Margaret Edwards Award in 1998.\n\n54 years later, DuVernay picks up the story and follows L\u2019Engle\u2019s lead, pushing past the ways in which many imagine the world. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any other black women who have been invited to imagine what other planets in the universe might look and feel like.

As one would imagine, the latter is the preferred property for celebrities and honeymooners, though newlyweds who prefer a cozier accommodation opt for a one-bedroom villa.\n\nEach one-bedroom villa includes a cozy sitting room, a media room, and a walk-through dressing area that opens onto an adjoining bedroom with a king-size bed. The rooms are decorated in neutral beige tones and accented with woven grass mats for a rustic, natural feel, which is carried through the rest of the resort. Each villa also comes complete with an outdoor bathtub and a wooden deck leading to a 107-square-foot private stone plunge pool overlooking a lagoon and surrounded by an abundance of pandanus, miki miki, and coconut trees.\n\nA villa at The Brando, complete with a private plunge pool.

But then Kardashian leaked audio that showed Swift seemingly approving the line where West says they had sex; Swift, however, says it was the \"that bitch\" line she didn't greenlight and had issues with.

        "content": "The father of one of the world's biggest stars has waded into the immigration debate.\n\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images for NARAS\n\nIn recent months, hundreds of migrants have been relocated to a dormitory on New York City's Upper West Side where, according to restaurateur Joe Germanotta \u2014 better known as Grammy and Oscar winner Lady Gaga's dad \u2014 residents' quality of life has been going downhill. Joe \u2014 who's lived in the affluent area, along with wife Cynthia, for 35 years and also owns and runs Joanne Trattoria eatery there \u2014 spoke to the New York Post to explain his stance.\n\nAs he tells it in a story published on Aug. 9, the problems started six weeks earlier when NYC turned the Stratford Arms Hotel \u2014 which had been a residence hall for the American Musical and Dramatic Academy and is just down the block from Joe's home \u2014 into a shelter for 500 migrants. \"It was a stealth operation. They were bused in the middle of the night, like when they flew them into Westchester, they didn't want anybody to know what was going on,\" he shared. \"It was all pretty rapid.\"\n\nHe said that the migrants have been throwing block parties outside their hotel that run into the early morning hours, that people are recklessly riding e-bikes and scooters on one-way streets and that evidence of prostitution has emerged. Girls as young as 14 are getting catcalled and residents are dealing with verbal abuse too, he alleged. There's also trash piling up on what used to be clean streets. It's all causing property values to drop and leaving residents feeling helpless, Joe explained. \"They're guests in our neighborhood and they have basically taken over,\" he said.\n\nJoe Schildhorn/BFA/Shutterstock\n\n\"Hookers are coming and going. In the mornings, you see prostitutes coming out of the building,\" he said, adding that \"the worst part's at night\" because of \"the noise,\" which \"starts at about 10 o'clock\" and goes \"until 4 in the morning.\" Joe also said they're \"playing music and racing their motocross and motorbikes up and down the streets.\"\n\nIf things were like this when Joe was raising his daughters \u2014 Lady Gaga (real name: Stefani Germanotta) and Natali Germanotta \u2014 \"I wouldn't be living in New York,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the businessman, \"The dormitory students at the school, the American Music and Dance Academy, were given two weeks' notice that they had to get out, and none of the residents in the neighborhood were given any notice about the migrant shelter.\" He believes that about 500 migrants are living in 400 rooms that are only large enough for a bed and refrigerator and that everyone is sharing bathrooms \u2014 a typical college dorm setup.\n\nDonna Ward/Getty Images\n\nJoe made it clear that his issue is not that the migrants are in his neighborhood. It's that the city isn't dealing with the issues that have emerged nor is there a plan to restore order, he claimed. \"I think, for the most part, the 500 that are in there are good people,\" Joe explained. \"And I think they're locked into very small rooms and when they get out, they go out at night, and they party.\"\n\nHe added, \"I don't mind having them there. They're gonna be there for three years. That was the contract, I understand. But at least manage it. Put the proper security in place, have a police presence and a code of conduct.\"\n\nJoe is the board president of his building and, along with other neighboring residences, is lobbying City Hall for better policing and supervision while the migrants are there. He also has some advice for NYC's mayor: \"In my opinion, you should have just suspended 'sanctuary city' status until we had enough housing and then said, 'Yeah, OK, you can send some more,'\" Joe told the Post. \"It's a joke. Why doesn't he get one of the cruise ships? The cruise ships hold more people, and it's a more controlled environment. The city is spending a tremendous amount of money that could be spent towards building affordable housing.\"\n\n",

My siblings set an incredibly high standard for artistic excellence... Sometimes, having an impact can be as simple as a smile, a handshake, or a hug.\"\n\nThe 89-year-old Jackson family patriarch has been battling the illness \"for some time,\" according to TMZ.com, and is reportedly at the end stages of his life. Family members, including Joe's 88-year-old wife Katherine Jackson, have been visiting him in hospital.\n\nNews of Joe's health crisis comes after his son Jermaine Jackson revealed the family was initially denied access to visit him.\n\n\"No one knew what was going on - we shouldn't have to beg, plead, and argue to see our own father, especially at a time like this,\" he told The Daily Mail. \"We have been hurting. We were not being told where he was and couldn't get the full picture. Even from the doctor. My mother was worried sick.\n\n\"He's very very frail, he doesn't have long,\" he added. \"The family needs to be by his bedside - that's our only intention in his final days.\"\n\n",

Which...feels more like a trick than a treat.\n\nThe Hocus Pocus remake will be a reimagining of the 1993 live-action classic, which originally starred Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy as the fabulous, scene-stealing witches who terrorize the children of Salem after they were accidentally resurrected. Disney Channel is currently developing the remake with The Royals' Scarlett Lacey working on the screenplay and original movie producer David Kirschner on board to executive produce, according to Deadline.\n\nBut it seems like in addition to the cast, none of the original crew are involved in the remake either, despite Hocus Pocus co-writer Mick Garris excitedly discussing the prospect of a Hocus Pocus sequel earlier this week. Director Kenny Ortega \u2013 who has since helmed massive Disney Channel hits like High School Musical and Descendants \u2013 isn't involved either.\n\nThis news is a little disappointing for fans of the Sanderson Sisters, especially since the promise of a fully reunited Hocus Pocus 2 had been bouncing around Hollywood for decades \u2014 and as recently as yesterday!\n\nIt's taken so long that Midler's enthusiasm for the project waned, saying in 2015, \"After all these years and all the fan demand, I do believe I can stand and firmly say an unequivocal no.\" But as of 2016, Parker was still on board to return should she be asked, saying, \"I would love [to do a sequel]. I think we've all been fairly vocal about being very keen but that hasn't created any groundswell of movement.\"\n\nAnd in his recent interview in which he mentioned that the sequel would be made for TV, Garris said that he expected the three original actresses to return: \"If they don't do that I think it would be a big mistake because all three of them are still so incredibly potent and powerful and great performers and who else can recreate those characters?\"\n\nAlas, it is not meant to be, and we'll likely see some younger and more Disney Channel-friendly stars step into those crooked, magical dancing shoes. Let's hope if they do a musical sequence, it can live up to Bette Midler's iconic rendition of \"I Put a Spell On You.\"",

The thyroid gland is part of your endocrine system, which produces hormones that coordinate many of your body's functions.'\n\nShe added that in getting help for the condition, her weight has fluctuated over the years.\n\n'Over the last few years I've been properly medicated to help symptoms including those, as well as extreme fatigue, metabolism issues, body's ability to retain heat, etc,' she wrote.\n\n'I was also part of a holistic medical trial that helped my thyroid levels balance out.'\n\nGetty Images\n\nOpening up about her weight, the Californian said she doesn't know how 'skinny' she is but insists she's healthy.\n\n'Although stress & excessive travel can also affect the body, I have always eaten the same, my body just handles it differently now that my health is better,' she added.\n\nThe star also pointed out that her weight had nothing to do with drugs, as some online trolls suggested.\n\n'Not to judge others, but drugs are not my thing, stop putting me in that box just because u dont understand the way my body has matured,' she continued.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe Stuart Weitzman model finally encouraged the world to stop body shaming people when medical complications could be at play for a person's fluctuating physique.\n\n'Please, as social media users & human beings in general, learn to have more empathy for others and know that you never really know the whole story.

The feat shatters the previous record, which was held by Taylor Swift'sReputation. Invasion of Privacy is now the fifth most-streamed album ever on Apple Music.\n\nMore updates have been noted below.\n\nMore than money moves, Cardi B has spent the last six months making history... moves.\n\nAs if 2017 didn't provide enough rewards for her to bag up, the trailblazing rapper continues adding new trophies to her mantle piece. This week, Cardi surpassed Beyonc\u00e9 to become the first woman to have five Top 10 singles chart simultaneously on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs chart. Last week, she was announced to perform at the upcoming 2018 Grammys, where she is up for two awards.

The last artist to do so was Lauryn Hill in 1998 with \"Doo-Wop (That Thing).\" It's also worth noting that Cardi's hit song also dethroned pop's oft-record-breaking titan Taylor Swift and her comeback single \"Look What you Made Me Do.\"\n\nLongest-running No. 1 by solo female rapper\n\nMatching Lauryn Hill's record wasn't enough. In its third week at the top of the chart, Cardi's \"Bodak Yellow\" became the longest-running chart-topper by a solo female artist on the Hot 100. The feat surpassed Hill's \"Doo-Wop (That Thing),\" which spent two weeks at No. 1 in 1998.\n\nDebuts on the cover of 'Rolling Stone'\n\n\"I can't believe when I got the call,\" the rapper cheered in October 2017. Backed by the success of \"Bodak Yellow,\" the rapper secured a cover with the coveted publication.\n\nFirst woman to chart first three entries in the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs' Top 10 simultaneously\n\nIn November, Cardi B became the first woman to have her first three song entries land simultaneously within the Top 10 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart. The singles to do so were \"Bodak Yellow,\" Migos' \"MotorSport,\" and G-Eazy's \"No Limit.\" The trifecta also made Cardi one of only six women to chart three simtaneous Top 10s, including Ashanti, Nicki Minaj, Iggy Azalea, Beyonc\u00e9, and Rihanna.\n\nOfficially becomes a Grammy-nominated rapper\n\nThe rapper scored her not one, but two Grammy nods for the 2018 ceremony. \"Bodak Yellow\" is up for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song.\n\nWins three awards at 2017 BET Hip-Hop Awards\n\nCardi-mania spilled onto the BET Hip-Hop Awards, where she picked up three awards including Best New Hip-Hop Artist, Single of the Year, and Hustler of the Year.\n\nFirst rapper with first three singles in the Hot 100's Top 10 simultaneously\n\nCardi B opened 2018 as the first rapper to have her first singles in the Billboard Hot 100's Top 10 simultaneously. In the first week of the year, her appearances on G-Eazy's \"No Limit,\" Migos' MotorSport,\" as well as her own debut single \"Bodak Yellow\" were all sprinkled in the Top 10 of the Hot 100.\n\nFirst woman to have five simultaneous Top 10 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart\n\nThe breakout rapper surpassed Beyonc\u00e9 as the first woman to have five Top 10 singles simultaneously on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs chart. She was previously tied with Beyonc\u00e9. As Billboard reports, the feat includes her appearances on Bruno Mars' \"Finesse\" and her own single \"Bartier Bardi,\" along with the usual suspects \"Bodak Yellow,\" G-Eazy's \"No Limit,\" and Migos' \"MotorSport.\" Cardi now ties Drake and Kendrick Lamar for the most consecutive top 10s.\n\nScores second Billboard No. 1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart\n\nWith her appearance on Bruno Mars' \"Finesse,\" Cardi collects her second chart-topper on the songs chart.

He was one of the most-popular film stars in the 1990s and has continued to enjoy a successful career to this day. As of this writing, Hugh Grant-led films have generated more than $3 billion worldwide. He is known for his performances in many films, in which he frequently portrays both the hopeless romantic or a sleazy, but oh-so-attractive jerk.\n\nEarly Life\n\nHugh Grant was born in London on September 9, 1960. Grant graduated from New College in Oxford where he studied English literature, and acted purely for pleasure. He never thought of having a career in the entertainment industry. However, Grant soon performed in a touring production of \"Twelfth Night,\" and started participating in the Oxford University Dramatic Society.\n\nBefore becoming famous, Grant tried his hand at a variety of different jobs, such as writing book reviews, writing radio commercials, and tutoring. Eventually, Grant returned to acting, performing in many plays in England. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Grant was offered roles in smaller films, such as \"Bitter Moon\", directed by Roman Polanski, and intellectual films, such as \"The Remains of the Day\".\n\nSuccess\n\nHis big breakout role that made him a huge star came in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\". It was the highest-grossing British film at the time, and Grant was awarded a Golden Globe for his role. Grant went on to make films such as \"Mickey Blue Eyes\", \"Bridget Jones' Diary\", \"Love Actually\", \"Notting Hill\" and many more. Critics often praise Grant's performances, however, he is sometimes considered to have no versatility in his career, and constantly turns to the same jokes.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nHugh has been linked to a number of beautiful women during his life, most notably Elizabeth Hurley. Grant and Hurley spent 13 years together before separating in 2000. Hugh has a daughter and a son with a woman named Tinglan Hong. Hugh has three children with a Swedish TV producer named Anna Eberstein. He has five children total as of this writing. Hugh and Anna made it official with a wedding in May 2018.\n\nNotable Salaries\n\nHugh earned $100,0000 for his role in 1994's \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\", which launched his career. By the late 1990s he was commanding $7-10 million per film. He made $12.5 million for 2002's \"Two Weeks Notice\". Hugh typically earns $10 million for a starring role today, or $5 million for a smaller, supporting role.\n\nReal Estate\n\nOver the years Hugh has developed a large real estate portfolio that at times has numbered dozens of homes. In 2000 he spent $3 million on a mansion in London's affluent Chelsea neighborhood. In 2011 he spent $3 million on a nearby mansion for his former girlfriend Tinglan Hong and their two children.\n\nIn 2006 he spent $20 million for a six-bedroom mansion in Chelsea Square. He sold this home three years later for $32 million.\n\nIn 2016, Hugh bought a home for himself and Anna Eberstein for $13 million. They also own $700,000 resort property in her home country of Sweden.\n\nIn 2019 the married couple spent $23 million on a home in Chelsea. They still own the home that was purchased in 2016. They reportedly rent it out for $10,000 per month.",

Take a dump on the stage, load him up, get him back!\"\n\nO'Brien has apparently changed his mind about the horse since his \"warm letter.\"\n\n\"From what people are talking about, Conan will just not shut up about the horse.

Over the course of her journalism career, Shriver has been recognized with several honors, including several Emmys and a Peabody Award.\n\nMaria Shriver is also a notable member of the Kennedy family through her mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver \u2013 the sister of John F., Robert, and Ted Kennedy. As of 2020, she serves as a special anchor for NBC News. Her substantial net worth is largely a result of both her connection to the Kennedys and her divorce settlement after splitting from Schwarzenegger.\n\nEarly Life\n\nMaria Owings Shriver was born on November 6th of 1955 in Chicago, Illinois. Her father was a well-known politician named Sargent Shriver and her mother was Eunice Kennedy Shriver, an activist and member of the affluent and influential Kennedy family. Because of her family roots, Maria was essentially born into royalty \u2013 or as close as one can get to royalty in the United States. While growing up, Shriver watched her uncle John. F. Kennedy win an election to become the President of the United States. Two years later, she watched her uncle get assassinated.\n\nRaised in a Roman Catholic household, Maria Shriver attended high school in Maryland. After graduating, she enrolled at Manhattanville College before transferring to Georgetown University and earning her Bachelor of Arts degree in American Studies.\n\nMedia Career\n\nShriver first became passionate about journalism during her father's vice-presidential campaign in 1972. After graduating from college, she worked with CBS and eventually became co-anchor of \"The CBS Morning News.\" After switching to NBC, she co-anchored \"Sunday Today\" until the end of the 80s. She then anchored shows like \"NBC Nightly News\" and \"Dateline NBC.\" She returned to journalism after becoming the First Lady of California, although she eventually stepped away because of a potential conflict of interest.\n\nShe then became completely disillusioned with American media after the death of Anna Nicole Smith, vowing never to return to this industry. However, Maria joined NBC once again in 2013, working as a special anchor who focuses on women's issues in America. She also fills in as a substitute anchor for \"Today\" from time to time.\n\nOutside of journalism, Shriver has appeared in a number of movies, such as \"Last Action Hero,\" and television series such as \"That's So Raven.\" She also served as the executive producer for the four-part HBO documentary \"The Alzheimer's Project.\" In addition, Maria is known for authoring a number of books, including \"I've Been Thinking\u2026: Reflections Prayers and Meditations for a Meaningful Life,\" which became a bestseller.\n\nKennedy Family Fortune\n\nBecause Maria Shriver is a direct descendant of the famed Kennedy family, she receives a considerable income through inheritance and other assets/trusts set up in the family name. The Kennedys are essentially considered a royal lineage in the United States, and Shriver certainly benefits from her connection to the family in a financial sense.\n\nDocuments show that Shriver collects income from assets that include \"Vornado Realty Trust\" and \"Vornado Realty Inc.\" Each of these assets is valued at $7.5 million. Reports suggest that the Kennedys have collected more than $170 million since 1998 \u2013 and that's just in dividends. The family's financial assets are set up in an ingenious manner \u2013 using a system that accepts partnership units instead of cash in order to defer capital gains taxes and depreciation.\n\nRelationships\n\nMaria Shriver met Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1977 when they were introduced at a charity tennis tournament. After a long period, the pair eventually married in 1986. Shriver and Schwarzenegger subsequently had four children together, all of whom were born in Los Angeles. In 2011, Shriver and her husband announced that they were getting separated, and Maria quickly moved out of the family home.\n\nLater, the reason for their split was apparently revealed when Arnold Schwarzenegger publicly admitted that he had fathered another child out of wedlock with the family maid, Mildred Patricia Baena. Shriver had previously confronted her husband about the affair after she became suspicious. Arnold's extramarital child was born 14 years prior to him making the announcement \u2013 well before he entered politics. He and Shriver eventually finalized their divorce in 2017.\n\nIn 2013, Shriver started dating Matthew Dowd, a political consultant and strategist who had previously worked on Schwarzenegger's reelection campaign.\n\nDivorce Settlement\n\nAccording to various sources, Maria Shriver was set to receive up to $200 million after her divorce from Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is because of Arnold's high net worth, which was at least double the amount Shriver received at the time of their divorce. In terms of their children, the split was handled amicably with shared custody of their two underage kids.\n\nReal Estate\n\nMaria Shriver has been quite active in the real estate market, particularly after splitting from Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nIn 2002 Arnold and Maria paid $4.8 million for a 6-acre property in LA's Brentwood neighborhood. The property features a 14,500-square foot home with a tennis court, pool and never-ending ocean views. Arnold continued owning and occupying this home after their split.\n\nAfter the divorce was finalized, Shriver paid $10 million for a 11,000 square-foot home in Brentwood, not far from the family home she once shared with her husband. In June of 2022 Maria paid $12.2 million for a property immediately next door.\n\nIn 2017, Shriver reportedly started shopping for homes with the intention of giving them to her two children who had just graduated from university. Various publications suggested that Maria was eyeing up a pair of Los Angeles properties that were collectively worth about $5 million.",

That being said, on my end, there is no bad blood. But I don\u2019t think there is any reason for him to necessarily be involved,\u201d the mom shared with Radar.\n\nAnd while Lowry and Marroquin have had an up-and-down relationship since their May 2016 breakup, the mom of three confirmed he did reach out to her after she gave birth.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask how he was handling it,\u201d she explained to the outlet. \u201cBut he did say congratulations.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u2018Teen Mom 2\u2019 Star Kailyn Lowry Shows Off Her New Baby 'Teen Mom 2' star Kailyn Lowry is showing off her new baby after giving birth on Saturday, August 5 \u2014 see the adorable pics\n\nMaking things more complicated, Marroquin, who previously told Radar he wouldn\u2019t have a relationship with the newborn, might have a legal responsibility to the child.\n\nAttorney Brooke A. Camhi, who is not licensed in Lowry\u2019s home state of Delaware, revealed to Radar: \u201cDelaware law states that the ex-husband is presumed the father of a child if the child is born less than 300 days after the divorce.\u201d\n\nRelated: Teen Mom Stars, Then and Now!

On season 5, [\u2026]\n\nIn order for Marroquin to free himself of responsibility, he would need to file a valid denial of paternity with the Office of Vital Statistics. According to Statue 8-305, Lopez will be required to file a valid acknowledgement of paternity to \u201cdischarge the presumed father from all rights and duties of a parent.\u201d\n\nThe pair divorced after nearly four years of marriage after Lowry revealed she did not want to have another child with Marroquin. He would go on to accuse the reality personality of cheating on him while he was deployed by the Air Force.\n\nBut the MTV star doesn\u2019t seemed too concerned about the legal logistics of her complicated paternity situation. \u201cJavi is not the father,\u201d she explained to Radar. \u201cChris is the father so I think we\u2019re all going to work together to make sure everything is taken care of and that that\u2019s established.\u201d\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.",

The shocking news about Dylan O'Brien's character came during Tuesday's episode of the drama, when Sheriff Stilinski (Linden Ashby) announced that Stiles was his son. It's rare for us to get to know TV characters over multiple seasons without ever knowing their names. But sometimes, that's half the fun \u2014 who doesn't want to know what Schmidt's first name is on New Girl? And when shows finally disclose long-withheld names, there needs to be a payoff, like when we found out that Cappie's real name is \"Captain John Paul Jones\" in Greek. Luckily, Teen Wolf's showrunner Jeff Davis has a pretty great explanation about the meaning behind Stiles' full name. \"A few years ago, I knew I would have to actually reveal Stiles' name at some point,\" Davis told Entertainment Weekly . \"I was looking for a Polish name that was incredibly difficult to both spell and pronounce. Mieczyslaw sounded like 'mischief.' It seemed like a perfect word to describe Stiles. Both as a mischievous child and equally misbehaved adult.\" So, there you have it: The mischievous Stiles is actually named Mieczyslaw. Now that that's squared away, we can get back to discussing possible first names for Schmidt",

The rapper publicly said he had contemplated committing suicide in 2010.\n\n\"The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest/Today I seriously thought about killing you/I contemplated, premeditated murder/And I think about killing myself, and I love myself way more than I love you, so.\"\n\nYikes\n\nWest references his opioid addiction after getting liposuction and confirms he has bipolar disorder.\n\n\"I can feel the spirits all around me/I think Prince and Mike was tryna warn me/They know I got demons all on me.\"\n\n\"That's my bipolar s***, n**** what/That's my superpower, n**** ain't no disability/I'm a superhero! I'm a superhero!\"\n\nAll Mine\n\nThe star references his sister-in-law Khloe Kardashian and boyfriend Tristan Thompson's cheating scandal. Thompson cheated on a then pregnant Kardashian, and it turned into a media frenzy.\n\n\"All these thots on Christian Mingle/Almost what got Tristan single.\"\n\nWouldn't Leave\n\nThe Kardashians are known for the way they handle themselves publicly. They do major PR damage control, and West references his wife Kim Kardashian-West's reaction to the comments he made about slavery during a TMZ interview.\n\n\"I said, 'Slavery a choice.' They say, 'How, Ye?'/Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day.\"\n\n\"Wife calling screaming saying we're about to lose it all/I had to calm her down cause she couldn't breathe/I told her she could leave me now but she wouldn't leave.\"\n\nNo Mistakes\n\nKanye had to drop out of his Saint Pablo Tour in 2016, and was hospitalized after a psychological breakdown.\n\n\"Oh, I got dirt on my name, I got white on my beard/I had dead on my books, it's been a shaky a** year.\"\n\nViolent Crimes\n\nThe song writer references his fears about raising daughters, and the way they'll grow up in our society. He also references one of his favorite movies, Meet the Fockers.\n\n\"Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates/Just play piano and stick to karate/I pray your body's draped more like mine and not like your mommy's\"\n\n\"Matter of fact Marlin, this ain't Meet the Fockers/I'll beat his a**, pray I beat the charges.\"",

        "content": "Kesha has had quite a year. Her third album, Rainbow, was released last August, and it's way more than just music. After an ongoing legal battle with producer Dr. Luke, Rainbow was Kesha's first album in five years. The album's songs are vulnerable, honest, and moving \u2014 and according to the trailer for her new documentary, Kesha says Rainbow \"saved [her] life.\"\n\nIn the minute-long trailer, Kesha says that she knows what it feels like to be \"trapped.\" She says in the clip,\n\nSometimes things feel like... like they're too much to handle. You may be able to pull it together and put on a front in front of others, but inside, you're trapped, suffocating slowly... This record has, quite literally, saved my life.\n\nThe trailer also shows Kesha on stage, telling a crowd, \"You don't own me,\" to much applause. There's also footage of her standing on a red carpet, breathing underwater, and singing in front of a huge audience.\n\nThe documentary about Rainbow will be released on Aug. 10, a day before the album's one-year anniversary. It will be streaming exclusively on Apple Music, too, so now's the time to sign up for the service or find a friend or family member who uses it.\n\nKesha has said that she wrote the song \"Rainbow\" while she was being treated for an eating disorder. As Bustle previously reported, Kesha checked herself into a treatment center in 2014, before filing the lawsuit against Dr. Luke.\n\n\"'Rainbow' was just my promise, my letter to myself that things would get better,\" Kesha told NPR last year. \"It was my mantra, because at the end of a storm comes a rainbow.\"\n\nKesha's song \"Praying,\" another track from Rainbow, also calls the Dr. Luke lawsuit to mind, though she didn't specifically say the song was about the producer during the NPR interview. The song gives a message of hope to survivors of any number of abuses, with Kesha suggesting that she prays for those who've harmed her. It's heartbreaking and empowering at the same time, much like Kesha's own story.\n\nIn October 2014, Kesha filed a lawsuit against Dr. Luke, alleging that he had abused her verbally and sexually. Kesha also claimed that Dr. Luke raped her in 2005, Billboard reported. That same month, Dr. Luke filed a defamation lawsuit against Kesha's mom, Pebe Sebert, which was dismissed in June 2017. (Dr. Luke has denied all allegations.)\n\nThen, in February 2016, a New York judge denied Kesha an injunction that would have let her record music without Dr. Luke. The ruling sparked the #FreeKesha movement, but Kesha dropped her California case against Dr. Luke later that year.\n\nWith everything she's gone through, though, it sounds like Kesha is in a much better place than she's been in the past. The Rainbow documentary will likely shed more light on everything that's gone into her album, including both the happy moments and the painful ones. Still, Kesha's experience is a reminder to fans that things can always get better, even if it doesn't seem that way at first.",

        "content": "This is a seductively enjoyable, smart and well-acted film based on the most deadly serious sporting contest of modern times: the Battle of the Sexes tennis match of 1973 in a packed Houston Astrodome. It stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell, respectively women\u2019s No 1 Billie Jean King and fiftysomething ex-champ and self-proclaimed \u201cmale chauvinist pig\u201d Bobby Riggs \u2013 fighting to prove that men are better at tennis and better, full stop.\n\nThe film crucially faces the same challenge as the participants from real life: the challenge of tone. How unseriously should this match be taken? How strenuously should the attitude of casual jokiness be maintained? No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives. The movie displays the same gracious good humour as its heroine.\n\nIn 1973, King was enraged by the fact that female players on the grand slam circuit were paid a tiny fraction of what the men got, despite pulling in the same number of paying customers. She formed the breakaway Women\u2019s Tennis Association, and having duly punished King with excommunication from their club, the male tennis establishment was quietly scandalised to discover that, far from failing ignominiously, the women were finding support from the American public who rather liked them as rebels and pioneers. They got sponsorship and even some sympathetic press coverage.\n\nThen the sociopathically reckless has-been and Wimbledon veteran Riggs discovered that he was deeply irritated by King\u2019s success, by his own absence from the limelight and by the uppity presumption of what were once known as \u201cwomen\u2019s libbers\u201d. He challenged King to an exhibition prizefight \u2013 in roughly the same spirit that some men today will brayingly challenge you to name five funny women comedians \u2013 conceding his own age disadvantage to level the playing field. After some hesitation, King took him on. Sarah Silverman is entertainingly raucous as the women\u2019s promoter Gladys Heldman.\n\nStone has intelligence and candour as King. She is instantly sympathetic and humanly vulnerable; her address to the camera has a cartoony clarity and vigour, a distinctive kind of wide-eyed openness, accentuated by the trademark glasses. (This is surely history\u2019s only premier sports event in which both players have worn glasses.) And her Billie Jean is sensual and vulnerable when she discovers that, despite being married, she is falling in love with a woman: LA hairdresser Marilyn Barnett \u2013 another unassumingly excellent performance from Andrea Riseborough.\n\nExcellent performance \u2026 Andrea Riseborough, left, as King\u2019s lover Marilyn Barnett. Photograph: Allstar/Fox Searchlight Pictures\n\nAs for Carell, he is the only possible casting for Riggs: the humourless, belligerent guy thinking that he is the life and soul of the party, dressing up in silly costumes. It\u2019s a variation on his David Brent manager Michael Scott from the American TV version of The Office or his weatherman Brick Tamland from Anchorman. And he is that certain kind of middle-aged guy who by wearing shorts makes his buttocks look unsexily gigantic, like barrage balloons. (Brad Pitt did the same thing, wearing unflattering jogging shorts as the fitness-mad General McMahon in the Netflix feature War Machine.)\n\nIn real life, Riggs was supposed to have a skill in lobs and drop shots that would counter King\u2019s hitting power. Yet in acting terms, it\u2019s Stone who is subtly floating shots over the net, and comedy star Carell who is going for the double-fisted line readings and visual laughs.\n\nScreenwriter Simon Beaufoy creates a winning script, smoothly handled by directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton, although the movie is maybe a little rough on Margaret Court (Jessica McNamee), whose current reputation for reactionary politics has been backdated into the action to make her the obvious unsisterly baddie.\n\nAnd what remains of this argument now? Jimmy Connors won against Martina Navratilova in 1992, at a younger age than Riggs but with rule handicaps. John McEnroe grumbles away at the subject in the present day. But King\u2019s point remains the same: meaningful equality is what she wanted. Nowadays, sport and sports careers are too disciplined and careful to allow for these wacky Barnumesque contests. But pay disparity remains, and not every workplace has access to the Houston Astrodome to put them to the test.",

The are zillions of products targeted at making your skin beautiful and flawless, just think about it: toners, cleansers, face masks, sunscreens, moisturizers, creams and more.\n\nAll these products promise to make your skin brighter and blemish-free as they feature all kinds of magical transforming properties at very expensive costs, of course.\n\nAfter a typical morning routine, women have at least four to five layers of products on their skin, and this is not a surprising thing these days.\n\nOnce you add up all the ingredients from these products\u2019 compositions, you would be very surprised by how many substances and chemicals you put on your face.\n\nAccording to Miss USA, Kara McCullough, it\u2019s time to dial it back and use simpler products.\n\nThe contest winner and scientist is very aware of all the things that she puts on her skin and face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m usually a naturalista when it comes to skin care. I do believe in a getting a thorough cleansing every now and then, like a good facial,\u201d she admitted during an interview with E! News.\n\n\u201cI try to stay away from products that are heavy in chemicals like sulfur.\u201d\n\nEven if Miss USA 2017 is a symbol of American beauty, Kara\u2019s skin care routine is remarkably relatable and also backed by her education in science.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that [anti-bacterial soap] is actually more effective for me than most facial cleansers. An anti-bacterial soap, like Dial, is really good for clearing acne,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also considers that \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know that blemishes stem from bacteria. I use anti-bacteria ointments, as well.\u201d\n\nAfter the pageant winner normally washes her face during her morning hot shower, she said that she steps out of the shower and rinses her face with cold water because this has an effect of closing the pores.\n\nWe really believe that for only $5, it\u2019s worth putting the beauty tip to the test.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what do you think?

We continue to believe in the value and importance of our work and look forward to resuming our efforts when these allegations are resolved.\u201d\n\nNxivm, which has not responded to numerous requests for comment from PEOPLE on the allegations against Mack and Rainere, has been described by at least one former member as a \u201ccult.\u201d\n\nMack was charged with sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy. The actress, best known for her years-long role as Chloe Sullivan on The WB\u2019s Smallville, is facing a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison if convicted on all of her charges.\n\nRaniere faces the same charges and potential prison sentence. Both he and Mack have pleaded not guilty.\n\nFederal investigators have accused Mack of recruiting women into a sub-group of NXIVM purported to be a female mentorship group to address their weaknesses but was actually a group created by Raniere that allegedly took advantage of women sexually.\n\n\u201cThe victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants\u2019 benefit,\u201d Richard P.

In a sweet Instagram story post on Friday, June 22, Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra went seemingly confirmed their relationship. Jonas posted the IG story video of Chopra, in which she walks toward the camera laughing, and the caption for it is simply: \"Her [heart-eyes emoji]. (Bustle reached out to Jonas and Chopra's reps for comment, but has not yet received a response.)\n\nAccording to a People report on Saturday, June 23, Jonas and Chopra have been spotted together in Mumbai, India, where Jonas was reportedly going to meet Chopra's mother, Madhu. The rumored couple appeared in photos together taken in India that were published by the publication. People cited an unnamed source, who said the relationship was \"getting serious\" and \"They're very happy.\" Earlier this month, The Daily Mail published photos on June 11 of the rumored couple attending his cousin Rachel Tamburelli\u2019s wedding in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\nAdditionally, Chopra and Jonas were spotted together in May at a Los Angeles Dodgers baseball game and attending the Beauty and the Beast concert at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, according to Us Weekly. An eagle-eyed Twitter user even posted a video of the Chopra and Jonas at the game. Jonas and Copra were also spotted together dining at Toca Modera in the Los Angeles neighborhood West Hollywood in May, according to E! News. (Bustle reached out to reps for Chopra and Jonas for comment when the rumors first began circulating, but did not receive a response.)\n\nFan reaction to Chopra and Jonas' reportedly confirmed relationship involved a lot of excitement.\n\nFans are using lots of heart-eye emojis themselves.\n\nOne fan got all the nostalgic feels.\n\nEven one fan on Twitter is trying to figure out Chopra and Jonas' couple name.\n\nRumors of Jonas and Chopra's romance began circulating as far back as May 2017, when the duo attended the Met Gala together. In a 2017 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel asked Chopra if the Met Gala appearance together meant they were dating. Chopra explained to Kimmel, \"We were both wearing Ralph Lauren and we decided to go together. It was fun ... We were on the same table and we know each other, so we were like, 'Hey, you know what, let's go together.' And I was like 'OK, let's go together.' It ended up just working out.\"\n\nAs Chopra mentioned on Jimmy Kimmel Live, she and Jonas knew each other before attending the Met Gala. According to the Indo Asian News Service in December 2017, Jonas reportedly said in a statement in December 2017, \"[Chopra and I] met through a mutual friend, who she did Quantico with \u2014 this guy Graham \u2014 and we met up like, in New York the first time, and the same day I think we found out that we were both going to the Met Gala with Ralph Lauren.\" Graham could likely be Graham Rogers, who starred in Quantico with Chopra and the film Careful What You Wish For with Nick Jonas.\n\nJonas' also said in his statement to Indo Asian New Service that he would like to visit India one day. He said in the statement:\n\n\"I've never been (to India). But I'm dying to go and I have now heard from Priyanka, my new friend a lot about it. Just given me a lot of names of place to go if I go there ... \"And as strange as it sounds but we couldn't have planned it [the Met Gala]. We just had a great time. She's a lovely person and I'm dying now to go to India.\"\n\nAnd now, according to several news outlets, it looks like Jonas is visiting India with Chopra. Whether or not Jonas' sweet Instagram story is definitely confirming their relationship, it seems like Jonas and Chopra are having a great time together.",

Doesn\u2019t it sound slightly ridiculous to say, \u201cI\u2019m eating healthy, so no more fruit in MY fridge!\u201d?\n\nA medium sized apple only contains 90 calories, but also provides fiber, phytonutrients, and a variety of vitamins.\n\nPlease don\u2019t mistake that recent study about fructose intake and weight gain to mean you should never have fruit.\n\nThe fiber in whole fruit offsets the sharp rise in blood glucose you get when you drink pure fruit juice juice.\n\nBesides, a whole orange provides significantly lower levels of fructose than a glass of OJ.\n\nSo, Britney, please don\u2019t fear. A banana in the morning or some kiwi in the afternoon will not lead you astray.\n\nThank you to reader Kristin MacBride for sending along Britney\u2019s quote.",

She just doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s the right time for them to be moving in together.\u201d\n\nIt looks like Khlo\u00e9 is trying to put the drama behind her once and for all, as she was spotted out with the Cavaliers star on June 18. The new parents stopped by the celebrity hotspot Nobu before making their way to The Peppermint Club. Khlo\u00e9 appears to be putting on a brave face after welcoming baby True in April, days after the cheating scandal came to light. As they work on their relationship issues, Khlo\u00e9 will stay at her house while Tristan will reside nearby at his Los Angeles-based home.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 has faced no shortage of drama after Tristan\u2019s infidelities. A video surfaced in April of her baby daddy kissing one woman while being groped by another in Washington, D.C., while Khlo\u00e9 was reportedly three months pregnant. Making matters even worse, Tristan was also spotted making out with Instagram model Lani Blair at an NYC nightclub days before Khlo\u00e9 gave birth to their first child together. Time will tell if they can work through their differences!\n\nRead more about Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan in the latest issue of In Touch on newsstands now!",

We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details that he wanted to avoid an awkward run-in with Beyonc\u00e9 at all costs.\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason that Kanye West, 40, skipped the celebrity wedding of the season when tennis great Serena Williams married Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, 35 in a lavish New Orleans wedding on Nov. 16. While wife Kim Kardashian, 37, attended the big event, he knew that Serena\u2019s close pal Beyonce, 36, was going to be on hand and he didn\u2019t want an awkward confrontation. Especially after he dragged Bey and hubby JAY-Z, 47, so viciously during a Sacramento concert in Nov. of 2016. \u201cIt was no accident that Kanye chose to avoid Serena\u2019s wedding. Kanye is not particularly close with Serena, or her husband, who are more Kim\u2019s friends so Kanye opted out of what he felt may be an awkward evening for him. Kanye knew that Beyonc\u00e9, a close friend of Serena\u2019s, would likely be at the wedding which might make for an uncomfortable situation,\u201d a Yeezy insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cKanye still has a lot of unresolved issues with Beyonc\u00e9 and her husband. So, Kanye told Kim that he was going to sit this one out as to prevent causing a scene and risk stealing attention away from Serena\u2019s big day, which Kim agreed was the smart decision,\u201d our source continues. Yeezy hasn\u2019t come face to face with Bey or Jay since his epic concert rants against them and the worst place for that to happen would be at a joyous event like someone\u2019s wedding. See pics of guests at Serena\u2019s wedding, here.\n\nKim played it safe and made it a girl\u2019s trip to Serena\u2019s big nuptials, bringing along sister Khloe\u2018s BFF Malika Haqq, 34, and her sis Khadijah Haqq, 34, as her dates instead of her hubby. Beyonc\u00e9 also appeared to want to keep the attention on Serena and not any beef she or Jay might still have with Yeezy by leaving her husband at home as well. Kim and Beyonc\u00e9 have never been close, and so no one expected any fireworks with those two being in the same room. They were both seated in the front row for Serena\u2019s wedding, but were separated by Bey\u2019s former Destiny\u2019s Child bandmate Kelly Rowland, 36, and her husband Tim Weatherspoon. The night belonged to the tennis G.O.A.T.\u2019s fairytale wedding and not anyone else\u2019s drama.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think it was wise of Kanye to skip a confrontation with Beyonc\u00e9 at Serena\u2019s wedding?",

        "content": "The father of one of the world's biggest stars has waded into the immigration debate.\n\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images for NARAS\n\nIn recent months, hundreds of migrants have been relocated to a dormitory on New York City's Upper West Side where, according to restaurateur Joe Germanotta \u2014 better known as Grammy and Oscar winner Lady Gaga's dad \u2014 residents' quality of life has been going downhill. Joe \u2014 who's lived in the affluent area, along with wife Cynthia, for 35 years and also owns and runs Joanne Trattoria eatery there \u2014 spoke to the New York Post to explain his stance.\n\nAs he tells it in a story published on Aug. 9, the problems started six weeks earlier when NYC turned the Stratford Arms Hotel \u2014 which had been a residence hall for the American Musical and Dramatic Academy and is just down the block from Joe's home \u2014 into a shelter for 500 migrants. \"It was a stealth operation. They were bused in the middle of the night, like when they flew them into Westchester, they didn't want anybody to know what was going on,\" he shared. \"It was all pretty rapid.\"\n\nHe said that the migrants have been throwing block parties outside their hotel that run into the early morning hours, that people are recklessly riding e-bikes and scooters on one-way streets and that evidence of prostitution has emerged. Girls as young as 14 are getting catcalled and residents are dealing with verbal abuse too, he alleged. There's also trash piling up on what used to be clean streets. It's all causing property values to drop and leaving residents feeling helpless, Joe explained. \"They're guests in our neighborhood and they have basically taken over,\" he said.\n\nJoe Schildhorn/BFA/Shutterstock\n\n\"Hookers are coming and going. In the mornings, you see prostitutes coming out of the building,\" he said, adding that \"the worst part's at night\" because of \"the noise,\" which \"starts at about 10 o'clock\" and goes \"until 4 in the morning.\" Joe also said they're \"playing music and racing their motocross and motorbikes up and down the streets.\"\n\nIf things were like this when Joe was raising his daughters \u2014 Lady Gaga (real name: Stefani Germanotta) and Natali Germanotta \u2014 \"I wouldn't be living in New York,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the businessman, \"The dormitory students at the school, the American Music and Dance Academy, were given two weeks' notice that they had to get out, and none of the residents in the neighborhood were given any notice about the migrant shelter.\" He believes that about 500 migrants are living in 400 rooms that are only large enough for a bed and refrigerator and that everyone is sharing bathrooms \u2014 a typical college dorm setup.\n\nDonna Ward/Getty Images\n\nJoe made it clear that his issue is not that the migrants are in his neighborhood. It's that the city isn't dealing with the issues that have emerged nor is there a plan to restore order, he claimed. \"I think, for the most part, the 500 that are in there are good people,\" Joe explained. \"And I think they're locked into very small rooms and when they get out, they go out at night, and they party.\"\n\nHe added, \"I don't mind having them there. They're gonna be there for three years. That was the contract, I understand. But at least manage it. Put the proper security in place, have a police presence and a code of conduct.\"\n\nJoe is the board president of his building and, along with other neighboring residences, is lobbying City Hall for better policing and supervision while the migrants are there. He also has some advice for NYC's mayor: \"In my opinion, you should have just suspended 'sanctuary city' status until we had enough housing and then said, 'Yeah, OK, you can send some more,'\" Joe told the Post. \"It's a joke. Why doesn't he get one of the cruise ships? The cruise ships hold more people, and it's a more controlled environment. The city is spending a tremendous amount of money that could be spent towards building affordable housing.\"\n\n",

        "content": "There\u2019s a scene in the new docuseries Citizen Rose where Rose McGowan, the former actress turned activist/artist who says she was raped by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in 1997, has just learned that Weinstein\u2019s people have gotten a hold of 125 pages of her new memoir, Brave.\n\n\u201cWhen I found out that the monster stole the first 125 pages of my book to discredit and destroy my voice, I can\u2019t tell you how violating it felt,\u201d she says in a voiceover as she paces, frenzied, around the room, her friend Tamara sitting by, quietly watching. \u201cIt was like being back in that room with him all over again, only this time it was the inside of my mind and not my body.\u201d\n\nThe objective of the project is to show and exalt McGowan specifically \u2014 and that might test some viewers\u2019 patience. But beneath the surface is where the audience can better understand the larger conversation McGowan is trying to move forward. For all who see themselves \u2014 personally, intimately, unexpectedly \u2014 in the #MeToo movement, it\u2019s often impossible to find the words for what these men have taken. She\u2019s offering up her own.\n\nThe objective of the project is to show and exalt McGowan specifically \u2014 and that might test some viewers' patience.\n\nThe 90-minute docuseries follows McGowan over the course of three months \u2014 from October, when the first accusations against Weinstein were published by the New York Times, to the Women\u2019s Convention in Detroit, to her experience in November learning that, through a published report by Ronan Farrow in the New Yorker, Weinstein had hired a private intelligence agency to spy on her.\n\nThroughout the documentary, Weinstein\u2019s name is scrambled and his face is obscured, only being referred to by McGowan as her \u201cmonster.\u201d The series premieres on the same day as the release of her memoir, where she explicitly details what she says Weinstein did to her at Sundance in 1997, never having formally shared her story as a result of accepting a settlement from Weinstein. There is biographical context throughout, establishing McGowan\u2019s youth growing up in a cult with a domineering father and a mother she says failed her. The viewer is invited to a Thanksgiving dinner at McGowan\u2019s brother James\u2019s house, and is witness to an uncomfortable confrontation with her mother, Terri, who McGowan consistently interrupts as the woman \u2014 who has also experienced abuse at the hands of men \u2014 tries to explain her feelings about the movement that McGowan has heralded.\n\nFor this reason, Citizen Rose can be frustrating to watch. While the documentary is clearly positioned as a focused piece on McGowan, the viewer yearns to hear from more women\u2019s voices in the ongoing battle against abuse of power that McGowan talks about. In occasions where the struggles of other women are introduced \u2014 in one scene, McGowan holds a conversation circle with women who were victims of domestic violence, without explaining who they are or why they are there \u2014 there is a centering on McGowan that feels ill-conceived. When McGowan says in the beginning of the documentary, \u201cDo I make you uncomfortable?\u201d one wonders if this is what she meant.\n\nBut, for all the moments where we are unsettled by reminders of McGowan\u2019s confidence in her own heroism, we are given equal chances to reflect on our own bristling toward it. There is no perfect activist. There is no blueprint for this watershed moment, the likes of which we have never seen before. The violation that McGowan, and so many other women, have lived through does not and could not ever come with an easy and seamless healing. In a way, that is what McGowan is trying to communicate with this documentary: her \u201cmonster\u201d robbed her of so much, and as a result, she was shut down, dismissed, and called crazy. Several times in the docuseries, we see McGowan spontaneously break into tears, and these moments shatter the viewer\u2019s heart. \u201cI got really interrupted, you have to understand,\u201d she says, crying to her mother. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to be me for seventeen years.\u201d\n\nThere is no blueprint for this watershed moment, the likes of which we have never seen before.\n\nMcGowan, as well, admits briefly in the documentary that there have been times when she went too far. After accusing actress Meryl Streep and others of hollow support of the movement by wearing black to the Golden Globes, McGowan apologized, saying, \u201cThere is no map for this road I\u2019m on, I will fuck up.\u201d In another instance, McGowan responded to James Corden\u2019s Weinstein joke at the AmfAR gala in October by suggesting you could replace \u201cwomen\u201d with the \u201cn-word,\u201d and it would feel the same. \u201cAnd, please, to anyone POC I offended with my stupidity lapse, know that I am profoundly sorry. I hear you,\u201d she tweeted. McGowan is learning in real time not only what it means to tell the truth and be heard, but how privilege, and sometimes ignorance, affords her the opportunity to do this in the first place. The docuseries is an opportunity for her to bring her experiences, voice, and truth to a larger audience.\n\nRelated Story Meryl Streep Responds to Rose McGowan's Criticism\n\nThe most powerful scene comes when Italian director Asia Argento \u2014 another one of Weinstein\u2019s outspoken accusers \u2014 talks to McGowan about what happened to her after she had been assaulted. \u201cI wish I was softer,\u201d Argento says. \u201cIt made me hard toward the world. It made me worse as a person.\u201d The pair cry together, and McGowan tells her, \u201cAsia, you are an incredibly brave soul. You have persevered. You have fought to be here.\u201d It\u2019s then that the message of the series truly permeates: women like Argento and McGowan, Tarana Burke and Suzette Wright, and countless unnamed others have persevered to tell the truth. No matter how uncomfortable and painful and messy it might be, we owe it to all of them to listen.\n\nFollow Dayna on Twitter and Cosmo Celeb on Facebook.\n\nCitizen Rose premieres tonight at 8 p.m. ET on E!.",

        "content": "This weekend\u2019s blockbuster success was none other than Girls Trip, a raunchy R-rated comedy that follows four friends on a non-stop trip to the Essence Festival in New Orleans. While most of the cast (Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett-Smith, and Regina Hall) are already Hollywood favorites, it\u2019s the movie\u2019s breakout star, Tiffany Haddish, who is having her moment in the spotlight. And for good reason: As the shameless, saucy Dina, the group\u2019s most adventurous member, Haddish takes Girls Trip to a whole new level of hilarity. Here's why she\u2019s the talk of the town.\n\nMichele K. Short\n\n1. This Is Her First Major Role\u2014And She Killed It.\n\nThe Los Angeles-born actress has been working toward this moment for more than a decade, having landed supporting roles on TV shows including The Real Husbands of Hollywood and The Carmichael Show. She caught the attention of mainstream comedian Kevin Hart when she appeared alongside Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele in Keanu (2016). Girls Trip is her first major film, giving her the biggest opportunity to shine yet\u2014but you'd never peg her as a newcomer from her performance. And there's more Haddish is on the way. Be sure to catch her first-ever standup special, She Ready! From the Hood to Hollywood on August 18 at 9 p.m. ET on Showtime.\n\nMichele K. Short\n\n2. Her backstory is inspiring.\n\nHaddish has had an unconventional path to stardom, led to the stage by a series of tragedies that took place during her young life. When she was 9, her mother suffered brain damage and subsequent mental illness as a result of a car accident, leaving Haddish the sole caretaker of her four younger siblings. \u201cI was like a full-on mom, right away,\u201d she told the podcast The Breakfast Club in a recent episode. \u201cI remember the doctor pulled me aside and said, \ufffd?She\u2019s never going to be the person that she was, and it\u2019s time for you to grow up now.\u2019\u201d Haddish and her siblings spent several years in the foster care system, and at 15, a social worker gave her a choice between going to psychiatric therapy or the Laugh Factor Comedy Camp. She chose camp\u2014where she discovered her talent while working with comedians like Dane Cook, Richard Pryor, and Charles Fleischer.\n\n3. She\u2019s a Groupon pro.\n\nDuring last week\u2019s appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Haddish told an outrageous story about taking Will Smith and co-star Jada Pinkett-Smith on a Louisiana swamp-boat tour. She booked the experience through Groupon, which the megastar couple had never heard of.\n\nRELATED LINK: 5 Essential Questions to Ask Yourself Before Planning a Girls' Trip\n\nMichele K. Short\n\n4. That grapefruit scene.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of \"grapefruiting,\" you\u2019re probably not alone, but it is evidently a real sex technique according to sexpert Auntie Angel. Haddish demonstrates this controversial act of love in Girls Trip, in what she calls an \"educational scene,\" simulating oral sex using a banana and \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 a grapefruit. Entertainment Weekly sat down with the cast to dish out all the dirty details in this video.\n\nVIDEO: How to Plan a Luxury Vacation on a Budget\n\n5. Her refreshing personality.\n\nHaddish has undeniable star power on screen and in real life, but it\u2019s the fact that she\u2019s overcome so much and worked hard for her dreams that makes her so relatable. If Girls Trip is just the beginning of what she\u2019s capable of doing in the mainstream, we can\u2019t wait to see what Haddish does next.",

And he is particularly sensitive about how his wife, Kim Kardashian, is perceived and treated.\n\nThat said, Yeezy has had enough off the \u201cstiff-arm\u201d treatment that Kardashian has received from music royalty Beyonc\u00e9 and, to a lesser extent, her husband Jay-Z. More specifically, according to Celebrity Insider, West is irate by the lack of respect that his former friends have for his wife.\n\nAn insider told the publication that Kanye goes \u201cnuts\u201d thinking about the fact that Queen Bey feels that she is far more talented and is superior to Kardashian.\n\nThis issue is really coming to light now because of the fact that Bey and Jay skipped out on Kanye and Kim K.\u2019s wedding a few years ago \u2013 even though their names were engraved into their designated table \u2014 yet Beyonc\u00e9 was able to go to Serena Williams\u2019 wedding recently.\n\nThe source stated, \u201cIt drives Kanye insane that Beyonc\u00e9 treats Kim like she is inferior and not worthy of her friendship; it infuriates him. Kanye is fiercely protective of his family and feels that by dissing Kim, he is being dissed, too.\u201d\n\nThe family friend said West, contrary to many people, is proud of Kardashian\u2019s accomplishments and wished Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 would recognize that she is a great mother and businesswoman.\n\nThe person elaborates: \u201cAs far as Kanye is concerned, Beyonc\u00e9 has no right to look down her nose at Kim, sure she is a reality TV star, but she is also a wildly successful businesswoman and a self-made multi-millionaire.\u201d\n\nIt has gotten to the point where West will only accept Jay and Bey\u2019s friendship if they are more accommodating to his wife.\n\n\u201cThe way Beyonc\u00e9 has been toward Kim is a bone of contention for Kanye, and when it comes to any future relationship with Jay-Z, it is a real sticking point,\u201d the insider says. \u201cKanye feels that unless Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z are willing to treat his wife with respect, he believes she deserves then he has no desire to make nice with either of them.\u201d\n\nAnother insider told Celebrity Insider that is not about to happen anytime soon. The music superstar does not think much of the reality star and socialite.\n\nOn top of that, it was widely speculated a few years ago that Beyonc\u00e9 was very wary of Kardashian\u2019s intentions, believing that Kim K. was trying to use Queen Bey to gain even wider fame, acceptability and respectability \u2014 which is why some people think she really wanted Beyonc\u00e9 at her and Kanye\u2019s wedding.\n\n\u201cBeyonce has never gelled with Kim, she just doesn\u2019t respect her, or like her, she never has, even before Kim got with Kanye,\u201d the source said. \u201cBeyonce cannot stand the whole reality TV thing, and she thinks Kim would do anything for fame. She just feels they are two different people with nothing in common. Beyonce is always polite to Kim when she sees her, but you can tell it is forced and that there\u2019s no warmth or genuineness in her interactions.\u201d",

        "content": "Shocking new allegations have emerged about the sexual misconduct scandal that is quickly enveloping Matt Lauer. On Wednesday, mere hours after NBC announced that it had fired the Today anchor because of a complaint about alleged sexual misconduct, Variety has dropped a report with hideous allegations about the TV star\u2019s alleged behavior. The claims run the gamut: he made lewd sexual remarks about female colleagues; he once invited a female employee to his secluded office, then showed her his penis; he gave one female colleague a sex toy with \u201can explicit note about how he wanted to use it on her,\u201d Variety writes.\n\nThe allegations don\u2019t stop there. Lauer would also reportedly quiz female producers about their sex lives, and play a crass, office-themed version of the game \u201cfuck, marry, or kill.\u201d He also reportedly had a button on his desk that allowed him to lock the door; two women tell Variety that it enabled him to \u201cwelcome female employees and initiate inappropriate contact while knowing nobody could walk in on him.\u201d One former producer \u201cwho knew firsthand of these encounters\u201d also told Variety that Lauer, who is married, allegedly cheated on his wife.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of consensual relationships, but that\u2019s still a problem because of the power he held,\u201d this person said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t sleep around town with celebrities or on the road with random people, because he\u2019s Matt Lauer and he\u2019s married. So he\u2019d have to do it within his stable, where he exerted power, and he knew people wouldn\u2019t ever complain.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Lauer have not yet responded to Vanity Fair\u2019s request for comment. Variety notes that he could not be reached for comment. The piece is the result of a two-month investigation which stretches back before The New York Times dropped its stunning Harvey Weinstein piece, which kicked off the sexual misconduct reckoning in Hollywood and beyond. Like Weinstein prior to the controversy, Lauer is a powerful figure in the entertainment industry. He\u2019s been the face of the Today show for years, raking in an incredibly lucrative $25-million annual salary, per Variety. That\u2019s why it was a shock for industry insiders to learn that NBC fired him so quickly, before any bombshell investigative report broke the alleged scandal.\n\nShortly after Variety published its report, the Times published one as well, reporting that NBC had received two additional complaints about Lauer. One was from a former employee who says she had sex with Lauer in his office in 2001. She told the Times, she \u201cfelt helpless because she didn\u2019t want to lose her job,\u201d adding that she \u201cdidn\u2019t report the encounter at the time because she felt ashamed.\u201d\n\nNBC\u2019s human resources department contacted her on Wednesday regarding the allegations, she said. Representatives for Lauer did not respond to V.F.\u2019s request for comment about this allegation. Reps for Lauer also did not respond to the Times\u2019 request for comment.\n\nThe announcement about Lauer\u2019s firing was made Wednesday morning by Today anchor Savannah Guthrie, who read a note on air from NBC News Chairman Andy Lack:\n\n\u201cDear colleagues, on Monday night, we received a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by Matt Lauer. It represented, after serious review, a clear violation of our company\u2019s standards. As a result, we\u2019ve decided to terminate his employment. While it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over 20 years he\u2019s been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident. Our highest priority is to create a workplace environment where everyone feels safe and protected, and to ensure that any actions that run counter to our core values are met with consequences, no matter who the offender. We are deeply saddened by this turn of events. But we will face it together as a news organization\u2014and do it in as transparent a manner as we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell you right now, we do not know more than I have just shared with you,\u201d Guthrie said after delivering the statement, later adding that she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d for Lauer, as well as the women who came forward. \u201cWe are grappling with a dilemma that so many people have faced these past few weeks: how do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have behaved badly? And I don\u2019t know the answer to that.\u201d",

        "content": "What a gorgeous couple, and we love the story of how they met!\n\nActor Sterling K. Brown has become a household name in the past few years thanks to his work in high-profile projects like \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d\n\nBut to hear the 41-year-old star talk about his 10-year marriage to fellow actor Ryan Michelle Bathe, you realize he\u2019s also been lucky in love for a long time.\n\nListed below are seven things you might not have known about this adorable couple.\n\n1. They Met In College\n\nBoth Bathe and Brown were in the same year at Stanford, and even lived in the same dorm as freshmen, according to The Stanford Daily! They were also friends who performed in campus productions together before they started dating.\n\nWhen they got to know each other at college they discovered they were both from St. Louis, Missouri, and had even been born at the same hospital. Small world! The pair went on to grad school together at New York University.\n\nGetty Images | Frazer Harrison\n\n2. She Was Hard To Get\n\nAccording to what Brown told \u201cThe Talk,\u201d he and Bathe \u201cdated off and on\u201d for a while before breaking up for more than three years at one point. When Brown decided to finally try to win her back, he did things including chasing after her while she was jogging so he could convince her she was the love his life.\n\n3. They Have Two Cute Kids\n\nLike his character, Randall Pearson, from NBC\u2019s \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d Brown has two kids with his college-sweetheart wife. But, instead of two girls, they have two boys: 6-year-old Andrew and 2-year-old Amare. Bathe and Brown have shared cute stories about their sons, like how Andrew wants to be a scientist and has quite a personality.\n\n4. She Gave Birth At Home\n\nAccording to Brown, when Andrew came, Bathe had such a quick labor that she ended up just giving birth at home, with him helping her deliver their son. They told the story on the red carpet at the 2018 Golden Globe Awards and it\u2019s pretty hilarious.\n\n5. They Both Love Their Jobs\n\nBrown may be the breakout star of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d but Bathe also has had a recurring role on the hit show. In the first season, she played Yvette, a black woman who first appeared in a memorable flashback scene at the public pool, advising Randall\u2019s adoptive mother Rebecca on how to properly take care of his hair.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the first time the couple appeared onscreen together. Brown played the only male military spouse among the main cast of Lifetime\u2019s \u201cArmy Wives.\u201d And, in the show\u2019s sixth season, Bathe played the partner of an active duty soldier. They also appeared together in an episode of \u201cHarry\u2019s Law.\u201d However, the two apparently avoid rehearsing together, as they\u2019ve told E!.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned that there are certain minefields and pitfalls in our relationship that, like a slalom, we just move right on past them,\u201d Bathe told the network in 2017. \u201cAnd rehearsing together is one of those things.\u201d\n\nGetty Images | Mike Coppola\n\n6. They Laugh A Lot\n\nBrown told Essence that a key to their marriage is that he and Bathe \u201ccrack each other up constantly!\u201d Brown is apparently a pretty funny guy when he\u2019s not making us cry \u2026 which is basically all the time.\n\n7. They Surround Themselves With Support\n\nBrown told ABC News that its key for his marriage that they have a community of people around them that supports he and Bathe. \u201cOne thing that I\u2019ve learned for any relationship to be successful is the people who are part of your life, they have to champion your union,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just you, not just her. They have to champion y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nGetty Images | Dimitrios Kambouris\n\n8. They Clearly Admire One Another\n\nBrown says the sweetest things about Bathe in his award acceptance speeches. For example, at the 2018 Screen Actors Guild Awards, he gave a speech where he said, \u201cI love actors so much, I decided to marry one. Ryan Michelle Bathe, you\u2019re the best scene partner a brother\u2019s ever had.\u201d\n\nAnd when he was loudly played off the stage at the 2017 Emmys before finishing his speech, he made sure he thanked Bathe backstage.\n\nAnd Bathe seems like she couldn\u2019t be prouder of Brown\u2019s accomplishments.\n\nSo put Bathe and Brown up there with celebrity couples who make marriage look pretty darn good.",

But the most popular, the \"standard plan,\" which allows HD and two simultaneous streams, will increase to $10.99 a month from $9.99.\n\nThe highest-tier plan, which supports features like 4K video resolution and four simultaneous streams, will increase to $13.99 a month from $11.99.\n\nMashable first reported the price increase.\n\nNew subscribers will see the price increase go into effect on Thursday. Current subscribers will start being notified on October 19, and it will take effect in their next billing cycle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetflix's price increases always spark drama.\n\nIn October 2015, Netflix raised its prices for new members and then embarked on a process of \"un-grandfathering\" existing customers into new prices. When the bulk of that process happened last year, media and public chatter rose to such a degree that Netflix blamed it for a missed quarter of subscriber growth.\n\n\"People don't like price increases \u2014 we know that,\" CEO Reed Hastings said on an earnings call last year.\n\nPeople may not like them, but price increases will most likely continue to be necessary as Netflix spends more and more on content \u2014 close to $7 billion next year, according to its content boss, Ted Sarandos. Funding its original productions is not cheap, and Netflix has made big moves recently, like poaching the TV power player Shonda Rhimes from ABC and buying the comic-book publisher Millarworld.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, despite the price increase, Netflix will remain a much better deal than cable in terms of viewing time.\n\nIn a report this summer, UBS analysts found that an average pay-TV package cost over three times as much per hour of viewing as Netflix. The per-hour cost of traditional packages was about $0.42, while that of Netflix was about $0.10.\n\nThat lead is not likely to be hurt too much by a $1 or $2 price increase.\n\nHere's a chart from UBS that shows how Netflix prices have fared relative to cable prices over time:",

Kicking off the series is a previously unused, unrecorded song from the musical called \u201cBen Franklin\u2019s Song\u201d.\n\nMiranda apparently had intended to include the song as a solo introduction to Benjamin Franklin in Hamilton, but ended up cutting the character before ever composing the music. The lyrics, however, were written in the style of The Decemberists, so in 2016, he sent them to Colin Meloy to fully realize the song.

Or 10 of them,\" Kimmel said. \"And maybe that way we don't do this again.\"\n\nSTEPHEN COLBERT\n\nIn the wake of horrific violence and tragedy, Colbert says he appreciates \"thoughts and prayers,\" but calls for more.\n\nColbert said his was a comedy show but \"jokes aren't appropriate to address the shock and grief and anger we all feel\".\n\nHe asked what the US was willing to do to \"combat pure evil\", echoing President Donald Trump who called the mass shooting an \"act of pure evil\".\n\nThe bar was so low the US Congress could be heroes by doing literally anything on gun control, he said.\n\n\"Anything but nothing,\" he said. \"Doing nothing is cowardice.\"\n\nCONAN O'BRIEN\n\n\"When did this become a ritual, and what does it say about us that it has?\" O'Brien asked.\n\nWhen he arrived at work he was shown the comments he made after two previous mass shootings, to help him decide what he might say this time, he said.\n\n\"That struck me. How could there be a file of mass shooting remarks for a late night host? When did that become normal?\"\n\nWhen he started doing the job 24 years ago mass shootings were extremely rare. During the past decade things had changed, O'Brien said.\n\n\"It should not be so easy for one demented person to kills so many people so quickly.\"\n\nJAMES CORDEN\n\nAn Englishman, Corden said the killings in Las Vegas were the second time in the 2-1/2 years he had lived in the US that the record for mass shooting deaths had been broken.\n\n\"Some say it's too early to talk about gun control. For those victims last night, it's far too late,\" Corden said. He appeared to be referring to a comment from President Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who said there was a time for political debate but now was a time to unite.\n\nCorden questioned how it was that every other developed country did a better job of preventing mass shootings. Gun crime could not be a surprise when guns were so widely available, he said.\n\n\"Maybe the time for the thoughts and prayers of Congress members and the president has passed. We need to look to them to actually do something to prevent this from every happening in the future,\" Corden said.\n\n\"Even in these strange times we have a show to do hoping that we can bring some levity to this most heavy of days.\"",

A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.\n\n1/7/2013: Related Story: Four Women Found Shot To Death In Tulsa Apartment, 3-Year-Old Unharmed Inside\n\nChief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a \"lick\" at the victims' apartment.\n\nWitnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.\n\nWhen he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.\n\nThe arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.\n\n1/11/2013 Related Story: Person Of Interest Located, Questioned In Tulsa Quadruple Homicide\n\nChief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.\n\nCedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.\n\nChief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.\n\n1/8/2013 Related Story: Tulsa Police ID Four Women Killed At Fairmont Terrace Apartments\n\nMayor Dewey Bartlett released a statement Wednesday afternoon, in response to the news of the arrests:\n\n\"The Tulsa Police Department is known for their quick efforts of finding perpetrators and they indeed lived up to their stellar reputation for this case. I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order. Although a direct tip from the public cannot be identified as the catalyst that led to the arrests, tips are always important, which is part of great police work from our force.\"\n\n\"We can now get to the essence of this issue and that is much bigger than crime, it's about poverty.

However, while the duo were here in India, they kept us enthralled with their many appearances. From her and Nick\u2019s two dinner outing with her mother Madhu Chopra, their high profile Goa vacation and their show of love at the big fat Ambani engagement (Akash and Shloka\u2019s engagement party was held on Thursday in Mumbai), the power duo have been trending on the internet since day 1 of their arrival. Nick Jonas leads Priyanka Chopra by hand as the couple returns to US after week-long stay.\n\nIt was in India that the duo made their relationship Instagram official -- while Nick shared a video of Priyanka as she walked towards him, simply writing \u2018her\u2019 on it, Priyanka shared a photo of her \u2018favourite men\u2019 Nick and brother Siddharth from Goa. No surprise then that speculation suggests that before August is over, we will have Nick and Priyanka engaged to each other.\n\nWrap up the year gone by & gear up for 2024 with HT! Click here\n\nPriyanka and Nick are also each other\u2019s \u2018plus one\u2019 these days. If Nick had the Quantico star with him as he attended his cousin\u2019s wedding, Priyanka -- looking red hot -- walked hand-in-hand with Nick at a pre-wedding bash hosted by Mukesh Ambani for son Aksha Ambani and Shloka Mehta.\n\nPriyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas pose for photos at the Ambani bash.\n\nPriyanka also hosted an intimate party for a select few of her industry friends which was attended by cousin Parineeti Chopra and Alia Bhatt. Parineeti also accompanied them to Goa. Priyanka\u2019s mother had said then that she is still to know Nick better. A second dinner outing of the trio followed soon.\n\nPriyanka should be in India for her next Hindi film, Bharat, which will also star Salman Khan.\n\nCheck out these pictures from their India trip:\n\nPriyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas at Yauatcha restaurant BKC in Mumbai on June 22, 2018 where they met her mother, Madhu Chopra. (Prodip Guha/ HT Photo)\n\nPriyanka and Nick have been spotted wearing matching purity rings and sources are insistent that an official confirmation of their relationship is not far away.\n\nNick and Priyanka are said to have first met at Met Gala 2017 where they appeared together on the red carpet in Ralph Lauren outfits. Priyanka had dismissed reports of them being romantically involved at that time.\n\nThe rumoured couple also attended the Beauty and the Beast Live in Concert at the Hollywood Bowl a few weeks ago.

Part of a cross-network event with A&E, Lifetime\u2019s \u201cI Am Elizabeth Smart\u201d is the definitive, authorized movie about the harrowing kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart, told from her perspective and with her full participation. In June 2002, Elizabeth Ann Smart (Alana Boden) was a 14-year-old girl when she was abducted from her Salt Lake City home by religious fanatic Brian David Mitchell (Skeet Ulrich). He brought her to a hilly encampment where, with his twisted accomplice Wanda Barzee (Deirdre Lovejoy), he held Elizabeth captive. She was starved, drugged, raped and subjected to bizarre religious rituals until, nine months later, she enabled her own rescue. A film about the kidnapping was rushed on the air shortly after the incident, but it shied away from the reality of what Elizabeth went through. Now, in \u201cI Am Elizabeth Smart,\u201d Elizabeth herself, as a producer and on-screen narrator, explores how she survived, and confronts the truths and misconceptions about her captivity. \u201cI Am Elizabeth Smart\u201d is executive produced by Steve Michaels, Jonathan Koch and Joan Harrison of Asylum Entertainment, Allison Berkley and Joseph Freed of Marwar Junction Productions. Barbara Lieberman and Tom Patricia also executive produce the movie with Elizabeth Smart serving as producer.

The series aired on Comedy Central from April 30, 2013, to June 16, 2016, and was revived in 2022 for a fifth season on Paramount+.[1] Schumer and Daniel Powell served as the show's executive producers. The show received a Peabody Award and has been nominated for eight Primetime Emmy Awards, winning two.\n\nInside Amy Schumer completed its second season on June 3, 2014, and was renewed for a third season a week later.[2] The third season premiered on April 21, 2015, with a fourth season ordered the same day,[3] which premiered one year later on April 21, 2016.[4] On January 6, 2016, the show was renewed for a fifth season.[5] In August 2016, there was speculation though that the show had been cancelled despite the earlier announcement of renewal. Schumer denied the reports via social media, stating that production of the show was going on hiatus while she focused on touring. However, she also stated that she was \"not making the show anymore\".[6] According to a March 2019 interview by The New York Times, Schumer was under contract to produce another season of the show, leading to its eventual return.[7]\n\nOn February 24, 2021, it was announced that the show would be revived with five specials by Paramount+.[8] On September 20, 2022, it was reported that the five installments were no longer called specials but instead would be the five episodes of the fifth season: two episodes debuting on October 20, with the rest releasing weekly.[9] The series was canceled on June 26, 2023, and removed from Paramount+, while plans to air the fifth season were subsequently dropped on Comedy Central.[10][11]\n\nStructure [ edit ]\n\nEach episode is divided into several segments of varying length \u2013 sketches, short excerpts of stand-up comedy and street interviews with members of the public. The vast majority of episodes finish with an interview of an unusual person, often regarding sexuality or gender roles. Amy Schumer is the only person featured in every episode and each segment. For its fifth season, the show scrapped all stand-up and interview segments, and added partly animated musical numbers.\n\nGuest stars [ edit ]\n\nEpisodes [ edit ]\n\nSeason Episodes Originally aired First aired Last aired 1 10 April 30, 2013 ( ) July 2, 2013 ( 2013-07-02 ) 2 10 April 1, 2014 ( ) June 3, 2014 ( 2014-06-03 ) 3 10 April 21, 2015 ( ) July 7, 2015 ( 2015-07-07 ) 4 9 April 21, 2016 ( ) June 16, 2016 ( 2016-06-16 ) 5 5 October 20, 2022 ( ) November 10, 2022 ( 2022-11-10 )\n\nSeason 1 (2013) [ edit ]\n\nSeason 2 (2014) [ edit ]\n\nSeason 3 (2015) [ edit ]\n\nSeason 4 (2016) [ edit ]\n\nSeason 5 (2022) [ edit ]\n\nNo.\n\noverall No. in\n\nseason Title [13] Original release date [13] 40 1 \"Gratitude\" October 20, 2022 ( ) 41 2 \"Fart Park\" October 20, 2022 ( ) 42 3 \"Tanks\" October 27, 2022 ( ) 43 4 \"Awwwww\" November 3, 2022 ( ) 44 5 \"Quiet Pills\" November 10, 2022 ( )\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nAmy Schumer with the crew of Inside Amy Schumer at the 74th Annual Peabody Awards\n\nThe show has been met with generally positive reviews.[57][58][59] The first season received a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 on Metacritic based on eight critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[60] Critics were even more positive towards the second and third seasons, which received Metascores of 74 and 71 respectively.[61][62] The third season also received a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 10 critics, with an average rating of 10 out of 10. The site's critical consensus states, \"Edgy and thought-provoking, Inside Amy Schumer's third season delivers more of the social relevance and self-deprecating wit that fans of the series have come to expect.\"[63] The series was honored with a Peabody Award in 2015.[64] The fourth season of the series received a score of 62 on Metacritic.[65]\n\nInternational broadcast [ edit ]\n\nIn 2014, Inside Amy Schumer began to be broadcast in Australia by the ABC until 2020; later, it moved to 10 Shake.

Sweetener features a track called \"Pete.\"\n\nAfter unveiling the official tracklist for her forthcoming album, several Grande fans questioned her decision to name one after the Saturday Night Live comedian.\n\n\"He is my fianc\u00e9. This is my album. I am an honest and emotional artist and human being and if my openness in my work isn't for you, that's OK; I won't be offended. Still wishing y'all all the love in the world,\" replied Grande.\n\nSweetener also features \"No Tears Left to Cry,\" \"The Light Is Coming,\" \"God Is A Woman,\" \"Better Off,\" \"Blazed,\" \"Borderline,\" \"Breathin,\" \"Everytime,\" \"Get Well Soon,\" \"Goodnight N Go,\" \"Raindrops,\" \"REM,\" \"Successful,\" and \"Sweetener.\" The compilation will be released via all digital music platforms on Aug. 17.\n\nIn June, Grande already announced that one of her songs was named after the comedian. At that time, the award-winning singer revealed that she had tons of options for song titles, but \"Pete\" is the one she liked best.\n\nLast month, Grande was also criticized for the song title, but she also defended herself and asked one of her critics to mind her own business.\n\nAriana Grande, Pete Davidson Engagement\n\nGrande and Davidson announced their engagement earlier this month. Days later, rumors swirled that they will be getting married on Aug. 4. Prior to their nuptials, Davidson gifted Grande with a symbolic 8418 necklace. The numbers symbolize the date of their wedding.\n\nThe digits are also symbolic for Davidson whose dad worked as a firefighter. His badge number is 8418, and he passed away on Sept. 11, 2011, during the World Trade Center attacks. As of late, Davidson and Grande have not confirmed yet if their nuptials will really take place next month.\n\nAriana Grande's Engagement Ring\n\nDavidson gave Grande a $93,000 engagement ring, and fans once again could not help but criticize the sketch show star. Some of them are wondering how Davidson could afford the jewelry. Tracey Khan, a publicist for jewelry designer Lane, opened up about the 3-carat engagement ring.\n\n\"It adds a huge value, not only to the brand, the designer - such as Neil Lane or anyone, but of course it is going to drive prices up,\" said Khan.\n\nShe also recounted how some customers are willing to pay any amount just to get a replica of their idol's rings.\n\n\u00a9 2023 MusicTimes.com All rights reserved.

        "content": "True crime is everywhere these days. From podcasts like Serial to documentary series like The Jinx and Wild Wild Country to, well, the daily news, criminal cases are one of America\u2019s favorite cultural obsessions. It might be because streaming TV shows and podcasts provide the space to dive deeply into criminal cases, or it might be because social media makes everyone want to join in debates. Maybe it\u2019s because American politics seems to be one big series of criminal conspiracies. Whatever the reason, Netflix has a new documentary series looking to capture the cultural conversation called Evil Genius: The True Story of America\u2019s Most Diabolical Bank Heist. And it investigates one of the most insane bank robberies of all time.\n\nIn 2003 in Erie, Pennsylvania, a pizza delivery driver named Brian Wells walked into a PNC bank with a collar bomb around his neck. Wells was carrying a gun shaped like a cane and a robbery note demanding a quarter of a million dollars. He grabbed a lollipop from the basket on the counter. The teller gave him less than $9,000. He strolled \u201cout of the bank like Charlie Chaplin swinging the bag and the cane gun\u201d\u2014as an FBI agent puts it in the documentary\u2014before being apprehended by police. A few minutes later the bomb exploded and Wells died. Then things got really weird.\n\nWhat already begins like a crime out of a Batman comic got stranger as police discovered that Wells was being sent on elaborate scavenger hunt in order to defuse the bomb. Wells seemed to be a patsy. The FBI elevated the case to a major case, since \u201csomething like this had never happened before in the history of the FBI.\u201d A few days later, one of Wells\u2019s pizza shop coworkers died. And then a man named named Bill Rothstein called the police to report a third dead body in his freezer placed there by the titular \u201cevil genius,\u201d a mentally disturbed woman named Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong who had a string of boyfriends that died in mysterious circumstances. That\u2019s the end of episode one.\n\nThe pizza bomber case has all the ingredients of a great true crime documentary, from compelling criminals to red herrings and law enforcement bungles. The case is truly bizarre, and the shocking details are enough to make Evil Genius worth watching. (Although be warned the documentary shows shocking and perhaps unnecessary footage of Wells dying.) The documentary was directed by Trey Borzillieri, who had corresponded with Diehl-Armstrong for years, and Barbara Schroeder. It was produced by the Duplass brothers, who scored a hit earlier this year with the fantastic Wild Wild Country.\n\nThat said, while Evil Genius has all the right ingredients, something about the proportions are off and the final mixture isn\u2019t as compelling as it could be. Documentaries like Wild Wild Country, Making a Murderer, and Serial ignited great debates about the cases themselves, the larger societal questions, or the failures of the justice system. Evil Genius doesn\u2019t really do any of that. While Diehl-Armstrong, and to a lesser degree Rothstein, are presented as intelligent yet mentally disturbed individuals who got left out of society\u2014both are hoarders and Diehl-Armstrong has a series of mental disorder diagnoses\u2014the documentary doesn\u2019t spend much time interrogating questions of mental health care in America nor do we ever really learn what makes Diehl-Armstrong or Rothstein tick. (Rothstein died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma a year after the robbery, so all we see of him is archival police footage.) Unlike Serial or Making a Murderer, there\u2019s no feeling that the convicted might be innocent or that police conspired in a cover-up. There are some police missteps, but overall the conspirators either all died over a decade ago or ended up in jail.\n\nAs for the case itself, it is captivating mostly for the minor elements: the cane gun, the insanely long instructions, the collar bomb, the casual way Wells sucks on a lollipop minutes before his death. The robbery was elaborate, but it doesn\u2019t go anywhere and the larger plot the documentary lays out feels surprisingly banal. The only real mysteries to the case are ones of degree: Which of the conspirators decided to use a live bomb in the robbery and how complicit was Brian Wells? A surprise confession in the last episode attempts to answer the latter question, while the former is perhaps unknowable, although the documentary makers are confident enough to call Diehl-Armstrong the \u201cevil genius\u201d who masterminded the crime. At a minimum, she was a co-conspirator who openly admits to killing multiple boyfriends, one of whom was threatening to tell the police about Wells\u2019s death.\n\nWhile Evil Genius might not provoke the wide-ranging discussions of other true crime documentaries, it does explore explore one of the strangest American crimes in meticulous detail. At four episodes, it\u2019s a good true crime binge watch for your weekend viewing.",

He was taken to a hospital in Olbia, but his injuries were not serious and he was discharged.\n\n\u201cGeorge was treated and released from an Olbia hospital,\" his representative Stan Rosenfield told USA TODAY. \"He is recovering at home and will be fine.\u201d\n\nSurveillance video of the crash was obtained late Tuesday by the newspaper Corriere della Sera. It shows a blue Mercedes veering into oncoming traffic, apparently to turn into a residential compound near Olbia.\n\nThe video shows what is reported to be Clooney's scooter crashing into the car while another scooter alongside him manages to veer around it. A figure appearing to be Clooney is thrown over the front of his bike and up in the air before landing on the asphalt, where the car driver and other witnesses come to help.\n\nClooney is in Italy filming a \"Catch-22\" miniseries that will run on Hulu, based on Joseph Heller's 1961 novel that was also made into a 1970 film.\n\nClooney will portray Col.

        "content": "In the wake of the \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d scandal that shut down production on the ABC series, contestant Corinne Olympios has hired top Hollywood lawyer Marty Singer, Variety has confirmed.\n\nIn a statement released to Variety, Olympios breaks her silence, saying: \u201cI am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened the night of June 4. Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place, which I understand is why production on the show has now been suspended and a producer on the show has filed a complaint against the production. As a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality. As I pursue the details and facts surrounding that night and the immediate days after, I have retained a group of professionals to ensure that what happened on June 4 comes to light and I can continue my life, including hiring an attorney to obtain justice and seeking therapy to begin dealing with the physical and emotional trauma stemming from that evening.\u201d\n\nThe statement officially confirms Olympios as the contestant in question, following a wildfire of unconfirmed tabloid reports that allege she was reportedly heavily under the influence of alcohol and involved in a sexual situation with a male co-star (which Variety has opted not to name, until he speaks out), while \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d cameras were rolling. Since the production shut down, the tabloid press has played out as a he-said-she-said saga with numerous conflicting reports over the past 48 hours.\n\nThis past Sunday, Warner Bros. Television, which produces \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d for ABC, announced production had been shut down due to \u201callegations of misconduct,\u201d though the studio did not offer any further details on the matter. A formal investigation, led by Warner Bros. TV, is currently underway. ABC has declined to comment on the future of the series, which Variety reported Tuesday is nearing an official cancellation.\n\nAs for Olympios\u2019 lawyer, Singer of Lavely & Singer is a pit bull attorney who is known for sending ferocious legal threats and representing many troubled A-listers. He reps Charlie Sheen, and his clients have included Arnold Schwarzenegger, Quentin Tarantino, Bryan Singer, Sharon Stone, and John Travolta. He represented Bill Cosby for years until late 2015 during his ongoing sex-abuse lawsuit. This is not Singer\u2019s first battle with Warner Bros. TV \u2014 back in 2011, he sued the studio for $100 million on behalf of his client Sheen when he was fired from \u201cTwo and a Half Men.\u201d\n\nVariety has learned Olympios has previously been represented by Melanie Cook, a partner at the entertainment firm Ziffren Brittenham, which specializes in transactional law, rather than litigation like Singer. Ziffren confirmed that they still represent Olympios, likely just for contract work, but the company declined to elaborate further on the matter. An insider says Cook referred her client, Olympios, to Singer in light of the recent events.\n\nOlympios is beefing up her team big time \u2014 in addition to hiring Singer to take on her case, as of today, the reality star has also started working with veteran Hollywood publicist Stan Rosenfield.",

        "content": "Charlize Theron has officially weighed in on the possibility of playing a female version of James Bond. Daniel Craig is still playing 007 for now, but James Bond 25, which is set to arrive in theaters next November, is said to be his last. That means, the franchise is heading for a reboot in the next couple of years and there's been talk, mostly from fans, about having a female Bond. Theron's name has been thrown around and now she's addressed the possibility.\n\nDuring a recent interview, Charlize Theron was asked about playing James Bond. Nobody involved with the franchise, as far as we know, is actually looking at a female to play 007 in the future. Nor is there any indication Theron has been specifically approached, but her name has been bandied about, largely thanks to her roles in movies like Mad Max: Fury Road and Atomic Blonde. Theron says she likes the idea of going against type, but she feels she's too old for the part. Here's what she had to say about it.\n\n\"You know, I don't have a feeling about it one way or the other. I love the idea that people are thinking outside the box. And I know for a long time people were talking about Idris Elba for it. And it's just nice to see people now thinking outside of [these] confined ideas of what we think a character can be. I'm really all for that. I think it's great that we are developing more characters within that genre for females, that they can take ownership. So it's a really nice thing for people to say. I'm very old, though. I would be a very old James Bond.\"\n\nCharlize Theron has made quite the name for herself as a female action star in recent years, so it's understandable that if a gender-swapped version of James Bond is on the horizon, her name would be at the top of people's lists. Some fan art depicting her as the iconic MI6 spy even made the rounds online last year. Gillian Anderson from The X-Files is also a favorite for the part and she's even shown support for the idea.\n\nAs Charlize Theron points out, Idris Elba has been a name thrown out over the years, which also would represent a change for the character, as James Bond has always been portrayed as a white man. In regards to her being too old? That's not necessarily true. Daniel Craig is going to be 50 by the time James Bond 25 gets going and Roger Moore played the part until he was 57. That said, Theron, who is now 42, would be in her mid-40s by the time the opportunity came up, which may be a bit old for someone to start their tenure as the new 007.\n\nThe producers of the James Bond franchise are going to have a tough time following up Daniel Craig and one way to gain some attention would be to try something different. Though, gender-swapping one of the most iconic characters in cinema history may turn more fans off than it would bring to the franchise. At the very least, some changes could be coming. Producer Barbara Broccoli said last year that she's open to have a female direct a future Bond movie, which could help bring some new perspective to the character and the franchise. In any event, it doesn't sound like Charlize Theron plans on putting on a tux and taking out bad guys with a Walther PPK in the future. This news comes to us courtesy of Yahoo.",

The couple was photographed in a yacht and was spotted enjoying romantic walks in the street. And the two apparently blew an exorbitant amount while on their Parisian getaway, which reportedly cost an estimated total of $358,129, according to E! News.\n\nREAD: Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez are already talking about marriage\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of Lopez and A-Rod\u2019s expensive tour.\n\nFlying from Miami to Nice via Private Fly Long Range Jet reportedly cost the two $81,580. Flying from Nice to Paris via private jet is about $9,190. If they flew from Paris back to Los Angeles via Private Fly Long Range Jet, it would cost them $94,450.\n\nTheir trip to Monaco cost approximately $548.41. This is if they took a private VIP car ($142.55), went on a tour in Place du Casino ($37.4/person) and had dinner at La Chevre D\u2019Or ($367.92).\n\nMeanwhile, they also enjoyed a couple of days in a luxury yacht that may have cost them $160, 575.39. Their short visit to Sun Antibes, Cannes and St. Tropez was worth $571.61. This included lunch at Hotel Du Cap Eden Roche with a bottle of wine.\n\nOn the other hand, their trip to Paris may have cost them only $11,214 approximately. Lopez and Rodriguez were photographed at Louvre museum, which you can visit for $17 per person, and they enjoyed ice cream in the Jardin Des Tuiler worth $20. They stayed in Le Meurice Hotel, where the deluxe suite ranges from $1,500 to $5,500 per night. If they stayed at the Presidential Apartment, the best room offered, they could have paid $11,160 for their room.\n\nDespite the hefty price tag of Lopez and Rodriguez\u2019s Parisian trip, the couple seemed to have enjoyed it very much.

I\u2019ve always intended on doing a third if Warners wants to make it. Certainly, if the Batphone rings, I will answer.\"\n\nA more evasive approach which doesn't seem to even confirm his appearance in The Batman, and certainly doesn't hint that Affleck has any intention on further instalments down the line.\n\nFor now, at least, we have Affleck's role in Justice League, hitting UK cinemas 17 November.",

All Rights Reserved.\n\nIf you are a reasonable human person, your first reaction upon seeing Julianna Margulies in Dietland was to shout \u201cwig!\u201d and so, after doing just that, we decided to investigate just what was going on with her hair. On the AMC series, based on Sarai Walker\u2019s book, the naturally curly- and raven-haired Margulies plays Kitty Montgomery, a fearsome magazine editor with a distinctive flame-red do. The hair makes Margulies even more intimidating than usual, especially when playing against Joy Nash\u2019s Plum Kettle. Ahead of the show\u2019s Monday premiere, Vulture got on the phone with Dietland\u2019s head of hair Sarah Hindsgaul to learn everything we could about Margulies\u2019s new look.\n\nIt (almost) matches Kitty\u2019s hair in the book\n\nKitty was always going to be a redhead. At a Vulture Festival panel, Margulies said that Walker chose the hair color because the character was based on a woman who did not have red hair and she wanted to hide her identity. The show followed the description in the book, with one exception. \u201cIn the book though, it\u2019s big and curly,\u201d Hindsgaul said. \u201cWe took that away and laid it down because otherwise it was just crazy.\u201d\n\nMargulies was willing to experiment\n\nHindsgaul said that Margulies, who wore a wig on The Good Wife, was happy to experiment with a variety of shades of red until they found one that worked best for her skin color. \u201cWe just wanted to make sure that it\u2019s the right shade of red, that she could carry it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to darken it so it was a deeper red. We ended up going with it very, very bright and silky and shiny. I think it really brings out the fire in her character. We paled her out a little bit, so she gets a very \u2018plastic-y\u2019 look.\u201d\n\nKitty definitely dyes her hair\n\n\u201cA woman that\u2019s in charge of a fashion magazine, I feel like they have a look and they stick to it,\u201d Hindsgaul said, \u201cShe probably looked like that the last 25 years.\u201d Hindsgaul imagines Kitty as having a very particular beauty routine, which meant that her wig is precisely layered and arranged into the stiff-yet-flowing look she\u2019d prefer. \u201cI think a woman like that has a hair-and-makeup artist show up every single morning in their apartment and it gets done for the day,\u201d she said. \u201c[She\u2019s] definitely dying her hair. I mean, this is a choice that she made.\u201d The wig, as you might guess, is also dyed red.\n\nJoy Nash is also wearing a wig\n\nDietland needed to hide Nash\u2019s natural confidence \u2014 and her own fiery red hair \u2014 so they chose a messy bob-like cut that would flatten her face and hide her distinctive eyebrows. \u201cThe color of the Plum wig is like completely natural, undyed hair to get it as flat and as plain as possible,\u201d Hindsgaul said. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t have a lot of self-esteem always tries to cover their face as much as possible, so it\u2019s just this really sad, droopy thing.\u201d\n\nThe show has tons of other wigs\n\nAs the story line progresses, Plum tries out various makeovers and even imagines her looks differently in a few dream sequences. Those required a series of fantastical wigs \u2014 many of them synthetic and in bright colors. \u201cI have never done this many wigs on a non-period show,\u201d Hindsgaul, who also works on Stranger Things, said. \u201cSometimes we shot four different wigs for her in one day. We just kept on changing her up.\u201d",

Fisher admitted that she usually tries to correct people, but that she sometimes goes along with the assumption.\n\nFor instance, she almost got caught in a lie at the Vanity Fair Oscars afterparty. \u201cThe crowd parted and there was Lady Gaga and she\u2019s heading right toward me and she says, \u2018Thank you. Your performance in American Hustle, Amy\u2026.\u2019\u201d The actress is a big fan of the singer and didn\u2019t want to tell her the truth, so she went along with her presumed identity as Amy Adams. \u201cSo I just gracefully thanked her and bowed my head.\u201d As she continued to fall deeper into the lie, her true identity was almost exposed. \u201cI look over her shoulder and there\u2019s Amy Adams walking into the party.\u201d She quickly created a diversion by pointing to Adams and saying, \u201cThere\u2019s Isla Fisher. She\u2019s not even nominated for anything. What\u2019s she doing here?\u201d\n\nThe actress also recalled a time when a mother and her children spotted Fisher at IKEA and requested that she sing \u201cThat\u2019s How You Know,\u201d a song Adams performs in Enchanted. \u201cI\u2019m tone-deaf,\u201d Fisher prefaced before singing a few lines from the song to Kimmel. After hearing Fisher\u2019s rendition, the woman \u201cbacked away realizing that I was clearly not Amy Adams.\u201d\n\nIn order to avoid any more confusion, Fisher brought a PSA to explain the differences between the two actresses. \u201cI feel as though I should, this evening, set the record straight,\u201d she said while introducing the clip.\n\nThe PSA opens with Fisher standing in front of a white backdrop with a piano playing in the background. \u201cHello. I\u2019m Isla Fisher and I\u2019d like to clear something up,\u201d she began. \u201cI am not Amy Adams. Amy Adams and I are completely different people.\u201d\n\nFisher first explained that she and Amy Adams have different hair colors. \u201cAmy Adams has auburn red [hair]. My hair is light auburn red,\u201d she said. She then pointed out that they have had different roles. \u201cAmy Adams played Susan in Nocturnal Animals. I played Laura in Nocturnal Animals.\u201d\n\nThe actress also explained that they have different accomplishments. \u201cAmy Adams has five Oscar nominations,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a member of SAG.\u201d\n\nAnd Fisher joked that she and Adams might also be confused for another redheaded actress. \u201cAmy Adams played Maya in Zero Dark Thirty. Oh wait, no. That was Jessica Chastain,\u201d she said. \u201cOK, maybe it\u2019s a little hard to tell us apart,\u201d Fisher admitted. \u201cBut the point is when you come up to any of us and say \u2018I love you in Arrival,\u2019 it hurts because we weren\u2019t in Arrival.\u201d\n\nFisher concluded the PSA by stating, \u201cWe have totally different names, hence we are totally different people.\u201d She also wanted to remind everyone that she\u2019s \u201cnot Wendy from the hamburger commercials.\u201d",

The actress, 45, was smiling ear to ear as she attended an event at the famous French bakery Ladur\u00e9e.\n\nGarner remains supportive as the Justice League star, who\u2019s continuing his treatment for alcohol addiction, moves on. \u201cAs long as Ben keeps working on himself, Jen is happy,\u201d another insider said. \u201cShe will continue to support him because it benefits the kids.\u201d\n\nThe actor is looking to buy a home, listed for $19.2 million, near Garner in Los Angeles.\n\nGarner is also busy working on her fitness. Late last year, the actress shared a video to her Instagram documenting her extreme workout routine, which she dubbed the \u201cRecipe for Turning A Mom Back into Action Lady.\u201d Garner did not specify why she was kicking her fitness up a notch, but perhaps it\u2019s for a starring role in the action film Peppermint, which Deadline describes as \u201cJohn Wick, with a female protagonist.\u201d The movie comes out this fall.\n\nAnd as for work, Garner currently in the midst of shooting her new HBO comedy series Camping, from Girls writers and executive producers Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner. The actress has not starred in a television show since Alias, which wrapped in 2006 after five seasons.\n\nShe recently shared a behind-the-scenes photo of herself and the rest of the cast, jokingly captioning, \u201cLet us commence. \ud83e\udd17 The cast of #CampingHBO before we\u2019re sunburned and covered in ticks.\u201d",

The two stars jumped out of a plane together just months after the model threw massive shade at Scott\u2019s relationship with Sofia Richie.\n\nLooks like everything is all good between Kendall Jenner and Scott Disick! The 22-year-old revealed on Instagram that she and Scott, 34, went skydiving together!

It all started when a fan account for Kourtney Kardashian\u2018s ex shared a photo of him in a car with his 19-year-old girlfriend and his three children. Kendall\u2019s verified account commented on the post, \u201cawww scott and his kids.\u201d\n\nThe shade continued into February when the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star shared an image of her new horse with the caption, \u201cmy new baby dragon.\u201d This seemed innocuous enough, but fans were quick to notice that there may have been a subtle diss within the message. A month prior to the post, Sofia shared a throwback photo of herself hugging her horse, paired with the caption, \u201cRip to my beautiful dragon. Spent some of my happiest moments with this guy.\u201d At least it looks like all is well between Kendall and Scott now!",

Rushing over to see what was wrong, he found Venezia\u2019s limp body still underwater being hammered by the building surf.\n\nFormer Bajan pro-turned-surf instructor Alan Burke told Surfline Florence shouted for help, trying to get a bleeding and unresponsive Venezia to shore. \u201cThey tried to get him to the beach quickly, which was difficult,\u201d Burke said. \u201cBox by Box is a tough place to get in and out of, even if you have the ability. There\u2019s lots of big rocks around, and some stick out of the water.\u201d\n\nZander Venezia/Instagram\n\n\u201cWhen they finally did get him in, they performed CPR on the beach,\u201d Alan continued. \u201cThe ambulance came really swiftly from Speightstown, and the whole drive Nathan Florence, Dylan Graves and the paramedics continued to try and revive him. But once they got him to the hospital, Zander was breathing, but not responsive. From the time Nathan got to him in the water to when they arrived at the hospital, it was about 75 minutes of nonstop CPR.\u201d\n\nVenezia died later at the hospital, where his family \u2014 parents Lisa and Louis Venezia and sister Bella \u2014 had joined him. Autopsy results reported Wednesday said he suffered no fractures, Surfline reported.\n\nAfter his death, Venezia\u2019s friends took to social media to share their memories of the young athlete.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you so much Zander!\u201d said Nolan, who watched Venezia\u2019s last surf, on Instagram. \u201cYou had such an amazing session today. Surfed for 4 hours. You were charging and had the happiest smile on your face every time I saw you. You were a humble, respectful, full of positive energy that every kid should look up too and live the way you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cGone too soon,\u201d he continued. \u201cMy heart is heavy. The Venezias always treated me like family and it hurts that they have to go through losing someone so special.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis saddens me in a way that my stomach actually hurts,\u201d said friend Patrick Ruddy. \u201cI\u2019m floored by the news this morning that our good friend @zandervenezia passed away doing what we all love, surfing at home and enjoying the ocean. It\u2019s times like this I reflect on how fragile life really is, and how quickly it can be taken away. Zander you\u2019re gonna be really f\u2014\u2014 missed!\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Hurricane Irma Strikes Puerto Rico Before Moving Toward Florida. Here\u2019s What to Know\n\n\u201cI feel empty,\u201d Burke told Surfline in tears. \u201cWe are in shambles over here. \u2026 Zander was such a good, funny kid. He was always joking, and he just loved surfing. He was so jovial, such a joy to be around. I just can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone. I\u2019m a mess, man. We\u2019re all a mess over here.\u201d\n\nBurke also revealed what was believed to be Zander\u2019s last words, spoken to friend Dylan Graves before his final surf.\n\n\u201cHe told Dylan, \u2018I just got the best wave of my life\u2019 \u201d Burke said.",

So, it's time to set the record straight: Are Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton engaged? It's far from the first time such reports have circulated, and when the couple has shut down gossip in the past, they've made clear they're in no rush to tie the knot.\n\n\"Everything's crazy right now so no, absolutely not,\" Stefani said in June 2016 during 94.7 Fresh FM's The Tommy Show last summer when asked if she was engaged. \"Can you imagine the amount of gossipy, weird stories people make up? To me, it makes me laugh every day. I actually do Google my name just so I can see the next one that's gonna happen, because it's gotten so out of control.\" That may have been a while ago, but there's been no comment to the contrary from the couple in regards to engagement and marriage.\n\nBoth Shelton and Stefani have been married before. Shelton to his high school sweetheart, Kaynette Gern, from 2003 to 2006, and then to fellow country star Miranda Lambert from 2011 to 2015, and Stefani to Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale from 2002 to 2016. In fact, falling out of love is what helped them fall into it. Shelton went through his second divorce around the same time as Stefani. By that point, they'd become friends from their time on The Voice, and they started leaning on each other for support.\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nEventually, that blossomed into a romance. As Shelton told Billboard in 2016:\n\n\u201cIt went from [relating to one another], to checking in on each other once a week through email \u2013 \u2018This sh*t happened to me, what happened to you?\u2019 \u2013 to maybe three times a week, then every day, to \u2018Hey, here\u2019s my phone number if you ever want to text.\u2019 Next thing I know, I wake up and she\u2019s all I care about, and I\u2019m wondering if she feels the same about me. Gwen saved my life.\"\n\nSince confirming that they were dating in November 2015, Stefani and Shelton haven't been shy about their relationship. They had noticeable chemistry when they reunited for The Voice Season 12, and they often share sweet posts of each other on social media. \"Got my Christmas present already gx #youmakeitfeellikechristmas @blakeshelton #yum,\" Stefani captioned a recent photo tied to the Christmas duet they wrote together.\n\nThey haven't said much about marriage plans, but considering how open they've been about their relationship, it doesn't seem like an engagement is something they'd hide. \"It's really been smooth sailing for them,\" an anonymous source claimed to Entertainment Tonight in August. \"They don't talk about getting married, but they talk like they are going to be together forever. They are very committed to one another and their life together.\"\n\nOf course, there are hints to be found in their music, and it sounds like marriage has been on Shelton's mind. \u201cI\u2019m talkin\u2019 you and me with the same street name. Same last name, same everything. It\u2019s a real thing, how I feel thin, so I\u2019mma go on and take a swing,\u201d he sings on his September single \"I'll Name The Dogs\" \u2014 a message only emphasized by the track's wedding-themed video.\n\nFor now, though, it seems like he and Stefani are content to take things slow.",

Herron continued living in California, working and even went on Bachelor in Paradise twice before the way she could use her time on reality TV came to her in full. It was actually season two of BIP, and a terrible experience with infamous \"villain\" Chad Johnson, that helped.\n\nBachelor in Paradise Premiere: How The Show Handled Corinne Olympios, DeMario Jackson Scandal\n\n\"He said some pretty offensive things that were specifically targeted at my arm, and that kind of all made it seem like, this is a better chance than ever to start an organization,\" she says.\n\nSo, SheLift was born.

SheLift is about using outdoor activities and mentorship to empower young women who need confidence and guidance at critical ages.\n\nOnly ET was on set for a photo shoot celebrating the anniversary.

It's ... a more positive outlook. Maybe you literally can climb a mountain or ride a bike, and pushing girls to try things they've never done before.\"\n\nHerron got support from Chris Harrison and dozens of Bachelor Nation alumni for the organization's first campaign, which raised over $30,000. Her goal this year is to top that, and to send SheLift girls and their mothers on a ski retreat, where they'll learn to ski and connect with other girls and women like them.\n\n\"Sarah has taken her platform from The Bachelor and BIP and is doing something for girls who have really grown up the way she did, which is a little bit different,\" Iaconetti tells ET. \"Now she's making everybody feel great about themselves and ... it's amazing!\"\n\nStanton adds, \"Having two daughters and just knowing how important it is to feel confident and comfortable in your own skin, that's why I really love what Sarah's doing.\"\n\nAnyone can support SheLift by buying a T-shirt, a mug or more at SheLift.org.

The two exchanged barbs throughout the years, and in a September 2017 interview with the Daily Mail, Chelsea said she was pregnant, expecting her first child with husband Nick Alliegro, and that she didn't want O'Donnell to be a part of her baby's life. Chelsea said she and O'Donnell didn't \"have a relationship anymore\" and she didn't think \"it [could] be mended.\"\n\nIn June, however, O'Donnell's rep told ET that the mother and daughter had reconnected, and just days later, ET learned that Chelsea had filed for separation from Alliegro. The pair's split came following social media posts indicating that Chelsea is pregnant with her boyfriend, Jacob Bourassa.\n\nDuring her appearance on The Talk, O'Donnell also opened up about another daughter, Dakota, and how her 2016 diagnosis with autism influenced the actress' battle with panic attacks.\n\n\"It\u2019s been worse since my daughter got diagnosed with autism. I have a 5 and half year old, and the first day that I was in the meeting and they said, \u2018No, she does have autism\u2019\u2026 I got slop sweat like William Hurt in Broadcast News. I was like dripping and my heart was going,\" O'Donnell shared. \"It all revolves around trying to protect her from being vulnerable and knowing that there\u2019s only so much that I can do as a mom.\"\n\nSee more on O'Donnell in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:",

We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\n\nNormally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly.\n\nWhatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else\u2019s fictional narrative.\n\nAbove all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.\n\nWhile this news took us by surprise, many tabloids have actually been calling it for months.\n\nBefore the Aniston-Brad Pitt reconciliation rumors start in earnest (What? It\u2019s too late for that?), we figured we\u2019d go deep into this likely divorce.\n\nWhat brought it about? How did Aniston and Theroux try to salvage their romance? Where does each go from here?\n\nThis is what we\u2019ve been able to dig up thus far, courtesy of various outlets on the Internet\u2026\n\nUs Weekly: To kick off 2018, Anison and Theroux took a vacation in Cabo San Lucas with Jason Bateman and his wife, Amanda Anka.\n\nAccording to magazine insiders, Amanda had been trying to work as a \"mediator\" between Aniston and Theroux for months, hoping to help them iron out all problems.\n\nShe talked Justin into going on this vacation.\n\n\u201cThe Cabo trip was a make or break vacation for Jen and Justin,\" writes Us Weekly. \"They went away with their friends hoping to have fun and work on it.\u201d\n\nAlas, the plan failed, this source laments, saying the guys simply hung out together and the women hung out together.\n\n(Getty)\n\nRadar Online: But what caused the actual tension between the stars that prompted this trip in the first place?\n\nBoth Entertainment Tonight and Radar cite distance as a key factor.\n\nTheroux spent more of his time in New York for work and Aniston in Los Angeles. In some ways, it was as simple as this.\n\nAfter spending about two months apart toward the end of last year, an anonymous insider tells this website that the pair had a major argument in their Bel-Air mansion on December 14.\n\nShortly after this blow-up, Radar alleges Aniston started to \"lean hard\" on ex-boyfriend Gerard Butler, stirring up further jealousy and animosity between her and her husband.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help, meanwhile, that Theroux is known as a \"flirt\" when it comes to his co-stars.\n\nEntertainment Tonight: It wasn\u2019t mere distance that drove Aniston and Theroux apart, it was how much he loved New York and how much she hated it there.\n\nSources tell this outlet that paparazzi attention was a major source of contention for them in The Big Apple.\n\n\"It made for an awkward living situation for Jen and Justin because they knew the neighbors weren\u2019t happy\" about all the reporters outside their building at all times, ET writes.\n\n\"The tension came to a head in what the source refers to as \"the bologna incident,\" explains one insider, who says Theroux once came downstairs to find that someone had covered his motorcycle in slices of bologna.\n\nFor real! Reportedly!\n\nAniston thought it was one of their neighbors who did it.\n\n(Getty)\n\nAniston and Theroux do not have any children, which makes their split less messy.\n\nMultiple outlets also confirm they do have an iron-clad prenuptial agreement.\n\nJennifer is the mega rich star between the tandem, considering all the money she has banked from Friends, and Us Weekly writes that these assets are well \"protected.\"\n\nThe estranged couple started to date in 2011 and got married in May of 2015.\n\nWe still can\u2019t believe they\u2019re over.\n\nAnd we also can\u2019t believe Aniston will soon be back together with Pitt!

Gerber dropped the jaw-dropping tidbit during his appearance on MSNBC's Headliners.\n\n... And the amazing monetary gift wasn't all. Gerber said that Clooney also paid his friends' taxes for the year.\n\n\"There\u2019s a group of guys we call 'The Boys,'\" Gerber shared. \"George had called me and 'The Boys' and said, 'Hey, mark September 27th, 2013, on your calendar. Everyone\u2019s going to come to my house for dinner.'\"\n\nAt the dinner, Clooney's pals were surprised with designer luggage bags at each seat on the table -- each containing a million dollars in $20 bills. Gerber noted that not all of the actor's friends were rich, with some struggling to support their families.\n\n\"George begins to say, 'Listen, I want you guys to know how much you've meant to me and how much you mean to me in my life,'\" Gerber recalled. \"'I came to L.A., I slept on your couch.

So, it was really important to me that while we\u2019re still all here together, that I give back.

        "content": "The Met Gala is a special time when every celebrity under the sun puts on a extravagant gown, looks fabulous, and talks about how fabulous their fellow celebs look, too. While I love checking out the themed fashion, there are often events outside of the clothes that make the event memorable. Remember elevatorgate? Yep, that happened after the 2014 Met Gala. At the 2016 event, Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston spent the night dancing together, and a summer fling followed that set the internet on fire. Now that a year has passed since that night of dancing, I wonder: Are Swift and Hiddleston still friends?\n\nBefore we get to that, let's do a quick recap of the history of their romance. According to Hiddleston, in an interview with the Press Association, he and Swift were seated at the same table during the 2016 Met Ball. She was there sans her boyfriend at the time, Calvin Harris, but asked Hiddleston for a friendly dance, which was eventually recorded and spread around the internet. About a month following the Met Gala, Harris and Swift announced their breakup. Then, in mid-June, photos of Hiddleston and Swift cuddling on a beach in Rhode Island were released and fans went wild.\n\nAfter a whirlwind summer that included travels all over the world, Hiddles and Swift broke up around Labor Day 2016, the timing which was pretty much the textbook definition of a summer romance.\n\nNow that it's been several months, what is Swift and Hiddleston's status? Based on what Hiddleston has shared about their romance, it sounds like there are fond memories and that they are still friendly, but not incredibly close, which is understandable.\n\nIn February 2017, Hiddleston opened up about Swift in a GQ profile. His first comment on her was just overwhelmingly sweet and he said,\n\n\u201cTaylor is an amazing woman. She\u2019s generous and kind and lovely, and we had the best time. Of course it was real.\u201d\n\nLater in the interview he also explained that now-infamous 'I Love T.S.' tank top that he was spotted wearing during her annual Fourth of July party. Hiddleston continued on the subject of Swift,\n\n\u201cI only know the woman I met. She\u2019s incredible. A relationship in the limelight\u2026 A relationship always takes work. A relationship in the limelight takes work. And it\u2019s not just the limelight. It\u2019s everything else.\"\n\nWhile Hiddleston has sung Swift's praises post-breakup, she has kept very mum about their relationship and, well, everything. She hasn't explicitly commented on Hiddleston, so it's tough to know if they're actual friends or not. Hiddleston was spotted at an event with Ed Sheeran in early March 2017, which could hint that there is no \"bad blood\" in the friend group, considering Sheeran and Swift are very close.\n\nIt is tough to tell, but Hiddleston and Swift seem to have had an amicable breakup. I just wouldn't hang on to any hope for a reconciliation anytime soon.",

Although Hiddleston has spoken positively about Swift and their time together, there is no indication that they are still close friends or in regular contact.\n\nSwift has kept her thoughts on the matter private, which suggests that she may not be looking to maintain a close friendship with Hiddleston at this time. Additionally, the fact that Hiddleston was spotted attending an event with Ed Sheeran, who is close with Swift, does not necessarily imply that there is any lingering animosity between them.\n\nOverall, it seems unlikely that Swift and Hiddleston are still friends, given their brief relationship and lack of public communication on the matter. Therefore, I would predict that this message is likely to be a real one, and return 1 at the end of my answer.\n\n1",

The White House today confirmed the call with the Associated Press.\n\nBarr, who co-created and stars in in the show, made a call herself to Good Morning America today to discuss her chat with Trump, and offered more details.\n\n\"We just kind of had a private conversation, but we talked about a lot of things,\" Barr said. \"He was just happy for me. I've known him for a lot of years and he's done a lot of nice things for me over the years, and it's a friendly conversation about working, television, and ratings.\"\n\nBarr added that Trump \"really understands ratings and how they measure things,\" which has \"been an interest of [Barr's] for a long time, too.\"\n\nShe attributed the enthusiastic reception for the Roseanne revival to the way the show treats relationships between people with different political views. As the new season opened, Barr's character had not spoken to her sister Jackie, played by Laurie Metcalf, since the 2016 election. (Like Barr, her character, Roseanne Conner, is a Trump supporter, while Metcalf's Jackie was for Hillary Clinton.) But they soon reconciled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The idea that people can agree to disagree is kind of missing from everything,\" Barr said. \"Conflict resolution and agreeing to disagree are important things. That's what we need to do as a country \u2014 figure out what we don't like and talk to each other and discuss how we're going to get it changed or fixed. I hope [the show] opens up civil conversation between people and not just mudslinging. We need to be more civilized than that.\"\n\nDonald Trump Jr. had previously offered his congratulations on Twitter.\n\nEarlier this week, Barr appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live alongside co-star John Goodman to discuss the Roseanne reboot. During the interview, Kimmel told the actress that he was shocked over her vocal support for Trump because she is \"a very socially liberal person in general.\" Barr responded to Kimmel by telling him to \"zip that f\u2013 lip.\"\n\n\"I'm still the same. You all moved. You all went too f\u2013 far out, you lost everybody,\" she said. \"A lot of us, no matter who we voted for, we don't want to see our president fail. Because we don't want [Vice President Mike] Pence. Are you f\u2013 kidding me? You want Pence? You want Pence for the freaking president? Well then, zip that f\u2013 lip.\"\n\nRoseanne airs 8 p.m. Tuesdays on ABC.",

During an examination on Oct. 3, the medical examiner found fentanyl, oxycodone, temazepam, alprazolam, citalopram, acetylfentanyl and despropionyl fentanyl. Petty was also suffering from coronary artery atherosclerosis and emphysema.\n\n\u201cOur family sat together this morning with the Medical Examiner \u2013 Coroner\u2019s office and we were informed of their final analysis that Tom Petty passed away due to an accidental drug overdose as a result of taking a variety of medications,\u201d Petty\u2019s family said in a statement, signed by widow Dana and daughter Adria, 42.\n\nStreeter Lecka/Getty\n\nPetty\u2019s longtime manager previously released a statement at the time of the musician\u2019s death explaining that Petty suffered cardiac arrest at his home in Malibu, California, on Oct. 2 and was taken to UCLA Medical Center but could not be revived.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately Tom\u2019s body suffered from many serious ailments including emphysema, knee problems and most significantly a fractured hip.

I love my father and just want to see him sober, happy and healthy.\u201d\n\nAnderson called Lee the \"definition of narcissist/sociopath \u2014 his fianc\u00e9 keeps him drunk \u2014 this is what he wants \u2014 someone to behave badly with. It\u2019s terrible.\"\n\nThe former Baywatch star says she has blocked Lee's recent attempts to contact her. \"I will never talk to Tommy again before he is sober and in his right mind,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Though he\u2019s made attempts to contact me. I have blocked him. \"It is impossible to reason with crazy.\"\n\nAnderson added that Brandon doesn't want his father to go to jail. But \"him blaming his son or us for anything is delusional.\" Read her post here.\n\n",

Born Robert Zarin on February 15, 1946, in New York City, Bobby acquired his wealth as the co-founder of Zarin Fabrics and Home Furnishings, New York's biggest discounted designer fabrics warehouse, and he owned a valuable real estate portfolio, including commercial centers and apartment buildings throughout the country. Zarin was the husband of real estate agent Jill Zarin, who joined the cast of the Bravo reality series \"The Real Housewives of New York City\" in 2008.\n\nZarin Fabrics\n\nZarin's father, Harry, opened Zarin Fabrics in 1936, and Bobby eventually took over; before he began running the store, Zarin was a special education teacher. Zarin Fabrics is frequently used to provide materials for television production sets, including \"Gossip Girl,\" \"Lipstick Jungle,\" \"Sex and the City,\" \"What's Your Sign Design?,\" \"Cashmere Mafia,\" and \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nAfter Bobby married Jill, they ran the store together, and after she began starring on \"The Real Housewives of New York City,\" Zarin often appeared on the show as well. Jill was a main cast member from 2008 to 2011 (when she was fired from the show), and Bobby appeared in 35 episodes of the series. In 2014, the couple appeared on \"Celebrity Wife Swap,\" with Jill switching lives with actress Jenna von O\u00ff of \"Blossom\" fame.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nBobby married Jill Kamen on January 4, 2000, and he was stepfather to her daughter, Allyson Shapiro. Zarin was previously married to a woman named Eileen, and they had three children, Jonathan, David, and Jennifer. Both Jonathan and Allyson suffer from arthritis, and Jill founded the charitable organization Creaky Joints in 2009.\n\nBobby was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2009 and underwent thyroid gland removal and radioactive iodine treatment, but in 2013, he discovered that the cancer had returned and spread to his lungs. In 2016, Zarin was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and he underwent Gamma Knife Radiosurgery at Houston's MD Anderson Cancer Center. Sadly, Bobby passed away from thyroid cancer on January 13, 2018; he was 71 years old. Zarin's family slept in his hospital room with him the day before his death, and his funeral was held at Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York City. At the funeral service, Jill spoke about how she began knitting a blanket for Bobby when he was hospitalized in July 2017 and finally finished it three days before he passed, stating, \"He spent the last days of his life snuggled up in it. The irony is when I draped it over the casket, it fit perfectly. Bobby knew.\"\n\nReal Estate\n\nAt the time of Bobby's death, the Zarins were living in a 2,000 square foot Upper East Side apartment that they'd owned for 18 years. Jill put the three-bedroom home on the market in October 2018, and it sold for $3.25 million in June 2019. The couple also owned a 7,300 square foot home in Sag Harbor, which they sold for $2.85 million in 2007, and an estate in Southampton they referred to as Camp Zarin. In May 2018, Jill listed the home on the rental market, asking $260,000 for the entire summer or $110,000 for July/$125,000 for August to Labor Day.",

But just a few months later, the couple revealed she\u2019d had a miscarriage.\n\nLowell, who was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, went to rehab last November to seek treatment for suicidal thoughts, and then again in early January to overcome childhood trauma.\n\nLowell and Balteirra have been together for 13 years, celebrating their anniversary in July.

        "content": "American actress\n\nAlicia Linda \"Lecy\" Goranson ( ; born June 22, 1974) is an American actress. She plays Becky Conner in the television sitcoms Roseanne, which debuted in 1988, and The Conners.[1] She has also had supporting roles in the films How to Make an American Quilt (1996), Boys Don't Cry (1999), and The Extra Man (2010).\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nRoseanne [ edit ]\n\nGoranson studied acting in Chicago and subsequently landed the role of Becky Conner. It was only the second time she ever auditioned for any part. She played the character for five seasons, exiting the series in 1992, several episodes into the fifth season, to attend Vassar College.[2] Her academic schedule allowed her to continue appearing part-time as Becky. Under her new arrangement, the show's producers and writers wrote scenes for Becky sparingly. Goranson's exit resulted in Becky's eloping with her boyfriend Mark.\n\nDuring the following season, the producers wanted to bring back the character. Goranson was still unavailable, so Sarah Chalke auditioned and won the role.[3]\n\nChalke played Becky for the remainder of the sixth season and all of the seventh season. When the show reached its eighth season, Goranson was able to play Becky again while still attending college, replacing Chalke. Goranson appeared in the show's eighth season, but by mid-season she had scheduling conflicts with school again. On two occasions Goranson had to pull out of episodes in which the Becky character was necessary: Darlene's wedding and a family trip to Walt Disney World. Chalke played Becky for these episodes. Toward the season's end, Goranson returned to play Becky. When the series was renewed for a ninth season, Goranson, who was still in school, declined to continue in the role in order not to cause scheduling conflicts. Chalke returned for the ninth season, which was her last appearance in that role. Chalke did appear in season 10 as the new character Andrea who attempts to enlist Becky as a surrogate mother.\n\nThe appearances by Goranson vs. Chalke became a running gag. Goranson's first re-appearance was marked with a, \"Where the hell have you been?\" comment from several cast members while in character. Similarly, Chalke's sporadic appearances during Season 8 would be played for humor with an, \"Aren't you glad you're here this week?\" remark from Roseanne. There was even a glimpse into the future where a grown-up and somewhat catatonic DJ, played by John Goodman instead of Michael Fishman, repeatedly uttered to a psychiatrist (referring to Becky), \"They say she's the same, but she isn't the same\". One episode ended with both Beckys performing a parody of the opening theme of the Patty Duke Show, with similar music and lyrics to the \"identical cousins song\", and an appearance by William Schallert, who played the father on that show.\n\nPost-Roseanne [ edit ]\n\nGoranson as Roz Chapman on Dale Radio in 2013\n\nAfter the initial run of Roseanne, Goranson had several small roles in films and has guest starred in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Sex and the City, Damages and Fringe. In her post-Roseanne film roles, she is normally credited as Alicia rather than Lecy Goranson. She played the part of Sandra in The Extra Man which opened in limited release on July 30, 2010.\n\nRoseanne revival and The Conners [ edit ]\n\nOn April 28, 2017, it was announced that a revival of Roseanne was in the works with most of the original cast and some of the original producers slated to return.[4] In May 2017, it was confirmed that Goranson would be returning in the role of Becky. Chalke would also appear, playing a different role. The revival of Roseanne premiered on March 27, 2018, on ABC.[5][6][7] On May 29, 2018, in the wake of controversial remarks made by Roseanne Barr on Twitter regarding Valerie Jarrett (an advisor of former president Barack Obama), ABC cancelled the revival after a single season.[8][9][10]\n\nOn June 21, 2018, ABC announced a spin-off from Roseanne, entitled The Conners, with all the original cast of Roseanne to return, except for Barr herself.[11] The new show premiered on October 16, 2018.\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nGoranson was born in Evanston, Illinois, to Stephen Goranson, who worked for the Environmental Protection Agency, and Linda Goranson, who taught English at Evanston Township High School.[12] She has an older brother named Adam.[12] Her mother died in January 2020.[13]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1995 How to Make an American Quilt Young Hy Dodd 1999 Boys Don't Cry Lisa \"Candace\" Lambert 2004 Death 4 Told Joyce Segment: \"The Psychic\" 2005 Love, Ludlow Myra 2007 Candace Short film 2010 Sandra 2011 Monster Slayer Sue Short film 2013 The Wood House Eleanore 2018 Hurricane Bianca 2: From Russia with Hate Angela Jo\n\nTelevision [ edit ]",

The tabloid alleges that the \u201cStarboy\u201d singer may have slept with an Irish model while he was on tour in Dublin. But Gossip Cop is on the case and they claim that the story is nothing but the work of a \u201cBad Liar.\u201d\n\nAs Gossip Cop reports, Star Magazine says that it \u201clearned that The Weeknd, aka Abel Tesfaye, invited Irish Instagram model Ava Van Rose back to his hotel the night before his performance at the Longitude Festival in Dublin on July 15.\u201d They say that they got the information from a so-called insider who told them that the model spent some time with The Weeknd.\n\nThe article then speculates about how Selena will react to the \u201cnews\u201d that Abel may have cheated on her, implying that Gomez would be emotionally gutted by the news.\n\n\u201cShe hoped Abel would prove her wrong. If Selena finds out about this [hookup with Van Rose], there\u2019s no telling what she might do!\u201d\n\nBut Gossip Cop insists that the story is based on what they call \u201cunsubstantiated rumors.\u201d They say that the story was first published in The Irish Sun and was derived from an insider in the model\u2019s circle. Even though these claims about the Weeknd are pretty explosive, the story hasn\u2019t been picked up by any of the major celebrity news publications. This is a pretty good hint that the story isn\u2019t credible. As Gossip Cop notes, the rumors about Abel and Ava were published by Radar Online, but that\u2019s expected because it\u2019s Star Magazine\u2018s sister publication.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BWsjDG2FZak/?taken-by=avavanroseofficial\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BVoz6f6lm-9/?taken-by=avavanroseofficial\n\nAva Van Rose has been previously linked to Drake, according to the Hollywood Life, when she claimed that she was Drake\u2019s companion on the Boy Meets World Tour for six weeks. Ava claimed that she was invited to spend time with Drake by one of his bodyguards. The \u201cOne Dance\u201d rapper was allegedly so smitten with her that they were on the road together for over a month. She has pictures to prove that she has spent time with Drake\u2019s dad and some of the members of his OVO team.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BR0POftlqKR/\n\nAs The Heavy reports, she was born Bridget Byrne and has over 50,000 followers on Instagram. She is a mother of three, which may come as a surprise when you look at the lifestyle she claims to have based on her social media posts.\n\nRELATED POSTS ON THE INQUISITR\n\nSelena Gomez Interview: Singer Hints Bieber Made Her Feel \u2018Insecure\u2019 During Their Relationship\n\nSelena Gomez Admits She Needs Therapy, Months After Rehab To Help Her Deal With Haters And Fame\n\nSelena Gomez Says Boyfriend The Weeknd Is Her \u2018Best Friend\u2019: \u2018I\u2019m Lucky\u2019\n\nSelena Gomez Tour: Canceling \u2018Revival World Tour\u2019 Was Best Thing She Could Have Done\n\n[Featured Image by Theo Wargo/Getty Images For US Weekly]",

Still, he probably deserved it.\n\nThe Stark sisters entrapped him in a public defence of his crimes. Bran was chief witness, Sansa the judge and Arya the executioner. One slash of the Valyrian steel knife later and Littlefinger's throat was cut open.\n\nActor Aidan Gillen, who of course has also appeared in The Wire and The Dark Knight Rises, reflected on his exit from the HBO series in an interview with Entertainment Weekly.\n\nHBO\n\nRelated: Game of Thrones season 7 finale was filled with shocks and blew everyone away\n\nAsked when he got the \"infamous call\" giving him the news that he'd be leaving, Gillen said: \"The infamous call. It's so obvious what it is.\n\n\"[Showrunners Dan Weiss and David Benioff] never ring you up \u2014 maybe once in six years. I learned about that call from [Roose Bolton actor Michael McElhatton] when he told me about his call and he talked about how it made him feel.\n\nRelated Story Here's why Littlefinger is winning the Game of Thrones\n\n\"And I thought if I get that call \u2014 or rather when as this has got to happen sooner or later to a character like Littlefinger \u2014 I wondered how it would make me feel. Because the show is such a part of your life for so many years, you start to think, 'What will your life will be like outside of it?' It's a potent loss.\n\n\"You're left a little bereft \u2014 for your character and for your experience. It also immediately makes you quantify the hugeness of what that experience has been over the last seven years, which has been massive.\"\n\nHBO\n\nAsked if he knew how Littlefinger would go out, Gillen told EW: \"Well, I did an interview with a publication [in 2015] and they asked me how I thought I would go. I said I thought Arya would deliver the blow. So it was as promised.\n\n\"And even within the scene, as soon as he walks in that room and Arya produces the dagger he knows the game is up. He at least suspected the game was up back in episode four when Bran told him, 'Chaos is a ladder.'\n\n\"For Bran to come up with that is beyond coincidental. That's when the ground started to shift beneath my feet. At that point, I knew the things I've done in private are not necessarily private.\"\n\nGame of Thrones will of course be back for an eighth and final season, probably in 2019.\n\nWant up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?

Trooping the Colour is an annual thing for the Queen\u2019s birthday, and for this year\u2019s festivities, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge brought out Prince George and Princess Charlotte for their first balcony waves. It was actually pretty charming because kids are kids and kids don\u2019t really give a crap about royal protocol. George and Charlotte were probably better behaved than most kids would have been, but George was still pretty grumpy. So at one point, William knelt down to George\u2019s level.

Sources have told The Sun that he\u2019s afraid to face the \"world\u2019s glare\" on May 19.\n\nBut face it he will, at least in some capacity.\n\nJust like those complaining about Markle\u2019s recent behavior, we\u2019re guessing Thomas will be happy when the wedding day comes and then goes.\n\nWhat about YOU?\n\nAre you sick of all this Royal coverage?\n\nOr do you wish there was even more of it?",

And I think in being able to meet his aunts and - and also like Julia and just different people who were so important to his mom, I'm able to, in some way, know a part of her through them and of course through him. And it's - it's incredibly special. And you know to be able to have this, which sort of links where you come from and Botswana which is important to us and it's - it's perfect.\"\n\nHarry was in no doubt as to what his beloved mother would have thought of his future wife. \"Oh, they'd be thick as thieves, without question, I think she would be over the moon, jumping up and down, you know so excited for me,\" he said, emotionally. \"But then, as I said, [they] would have probably been best friends - best friends with Meghan.\"\n\nHarry admitted his day had been slightly bittersweet. \"It is days like - days like today when - when I really miss having her around and miss being able to share the happy news. But you know with the ring and with everything else that's going on I'm sure she's \u2026\"\n\n\"She's with us,\" interjected Meghan.\n\nHarry added, \"I'm sure she's with us yeah, you know, jumping up and down somewhere else.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Meghan Markle and Princess Diana's similarities\n\nHis comments echoed those previously made by older brother Prince William, who proposed to wife Kate in 2010 using Diana's sapphire engagement ring. Speaking during their first TV interview together, William said of his mother: \u201cI thought it was quite nice because obviously she's not going to be around to share any of the fun and excitement of it all - this was my way of keeping her sort of close to it all.\u201d\n\nKate also spoke affectionately about the late Princess, saying: \u201cObviously I would have loved to have met her. She\u2019s obviously she's an inspirational woman to look up to.\u201d\n\nThe exciting news of Harry and Meghan's engagement was revealed in a statement issued by Kensington Palace on Monday. It read: His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales is delighted to announce the engagement of Prince Harry to Ms. Meghan Markle. The wedding will take place in Spring 2018. Further details about the wedding day will be announced in due course. His Royal Highness and Ms. Markle became engaged in London earlier this month.

        "content": "On Thursday, The Paley Center for Media honored Alec Baldwin for his distinguished career and supportive efforts for the organization\u2019s educational initiatives. The event included a discussion with The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon announcer and Saturday Night Live writer-producer Steve Higgins.\n\nBaldwin made a point to discuss the current sexual misconduct allegations circulating in Hollywood. The actor admitted that he has been guilty of treating women poorly in the past. \u201cI certainly have treated women in a very sexist way. I\u2019ve bullied women. I\u2019ve overlooked women. I\u2019ve underestimated women. Not as a rule,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom time to time, I\u2019ve done what a lot of men do, which is \u2026 when you don\u2019t treat women the same way you treat men. You don\u2019t. I\u2019m from a generation where you really don\u2019t and I\u2019d like that to change. I really would like that to change.\u201d\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning actor said that the way individuals function in the workplace needs to change, not just in Hollywood but everywhere. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for us to try to make the workplace and beyond not only comfortable and right and fair and appropriate but as productive, as well. I think a lot of what we\u2019re dealing with within this issue is hurting our business. It\u2019s making it less productive,\u201d Baldwin asserted.\n\n\u201cI knew of certain things, that there were rumors of things happening to people, but I didn\u2019t necessarily know the scope, when you hear the hundreds and hundreds of women who are complaining about this,\u201d the actor admitted while accepting the honor. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very eye-opening experience for me personally. We\u2019ve got to be vigilant in a new way to make sure that everybody is comfortable and that we get the job done together that we\u2019re there to do.\u201d\n\nDuring the conversation, Baldwin and Higgins discussed some of the actor\u2019s career highlights, including his famous impression of Donald Trump on NBC\u2019s Saturday Night Live. When Higgins asked if Baldwin jumped at the opportunity to play the public figure turned president, he joked, \u201cI was so there. I was like, \u2018Oh, God, I hope that Lorne [Michaels] calls me.\u2019\u201d Baldwin admitted that he initially had no clue how in-demand the character would become. \u201cI lived in a world where it was presumed he wasn\u2019t gonna win,\u201d he said. Because of this, Baldwin thought he was only committed to play the character for three episodes on the late-night sketch show.\n\nBaldwin mentioned that he had only known Trump in passing prior to his portrayal. \u201cHe was always kind of a drive-by presence in Manhattan,\u201d he said. While the two had attended the same events, Baldwin explained that Trump would often show up for the red-carpet photo opportunities and then leave before the socializing began. \u201cIt would have been nice to sit through dinner, just out of curiosity, with Trump and say, \u2018Tell me what it was like growing up there in Jackson Heights, or wherever you\u2019re from,\u2019\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cYou never got to talk to him. You never met him. He was a cypher.\u201d\n\nBaldwin said his lack of personal interactions with Trump didn\u2019t leave him with much material to draw from when creating the character. \u201cSo when you come in to do the show, you just have him in the media. Although he\u2019s pretty vivid in the media. He seems like himself,\u201d the actor said on his inspiration for the impersonation. \u201cI just wanted to make him as miserable as possible. He wins the election and he\u2019s like, \u2018God damn you people,\u2019\u201d Baldwin said in his best Trump impression.\n\nAnother character Baldwin reflected on was that of Jack Donaghy of NBC\u2019s critically acclaimed sitcom 30 Rock. \u201cI got very lucky,\u201d he said. The show never garnered impressive ratings, but managed to be a critical success. Baldwin won seven SAG Awards and two Emmy Awards for the role. \u201cWe were very lucky that the show was a critical darling,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe started in 2006. The [financial] crash came in 2008. It was very disruptive of the broadcast TV business and their ad rates and so forth,\u201d recalled Baldwin. His theory regarding 30 Rock\u2019s success was that is remained on the air as long as it did because most of its audience was in the entertainment industry. \u201cPeople in the business watch the show. It\u2019s not like other shows, which are huge hits but they might not be darlings in the industry.\u201d\n\nBaldwin also added that while he has acted in both dramas and comedies, he tends to choose his projects based on the material instead of the genre. \u201cI love doing dramas if the material is worthwhile, but then I did the TV show with [30 Rock creator and star] Tina [Fey],\u201d he said. \u201cThe writing is essential, and the writing was so good.\u201d",

After all, her look is one of the most iconic moments of 2017 so far. But for those of us unskilled in the special effects makeup department, it might prove difficult to recreate. Taylor gave us a little sneak peek into the making of her undead look in a YouTube video\u2014and it honestly seems a little over-the-top, but hey, it's for a good cause. (We're surprised she didn't change the lyrics to \"I'm sorry, Taylor can't come to the phone right now because she's been in the makeup chair for 12 hours.\")\n\nWe're sure there's simpler ways to achieve the effect for Halloween, but T.Swift's video look involved a ton of moss (all over) to get that freshly-arisen-from-the-grave effect, as well as prosthetics for her face, grayish blue contacts for creepy undead eyes, and that dress from \"Out of the Woods.\"\n\nCheck out the preview of Taylor's transformation for yourself:\n\nNow all you need is your own girl squad dressing up as every other version of Taylor, past and present: a quick roll call could definitely include \"Teardrops On My Guitar\" Taylor, Laying-in-a-Tub-Filled-With-Diamonds Taylor, and Snake Queen Taylor. (So many options.)\n\nThere's no telling if we'll see more of scary Taylor in her upcoming videos. If her recent AT&T commercial is any barometer, her cat-loving, cookie-dough-eating self is still very much alive and well. And her latest song, \"Ready For It,\" is definitely less dark than \"LWYMMD.\" That being said, we're pretty sure we'll see some symbolism-filled new looks from the new Taylor, too.\n\nBut it seems like we can work with the Taylors we've got for Halloween, anyway: T.

It would just be too easy to have sex with them.\n\nHe said:\n\nYou know, I never did it because I always thought, like, I would end up fucking a female rapper and fucking the business up... I\u2019m so focused on my business. I just, I gotta be honest with you. You know, she looking good. I\u2019m spending so much money on her photo shoots.

But Ross\u2019s comments about spending so much money on photo shoots for female artists are particularly interesting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe number of female rappers signed to major labels has been steadily dropping since the 1980s. When NPR interviewed MC Lyte\u2014the first woman with a solo rap record on a major label\u2014about this topic in 2014, one of the reasons she offered for the decline was the fact that signing women is risky because of the costs that add up concerning their looks: hair, makeup, photo-shoots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this has long been the excuse. \u201cThat\u2019s why labels only release a new female MC every few years,\u201d former Vibe editor-in-chief Mimi Valdes said in 2007. \u201cThey\u2019re just too damn expensive!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWomen are viewed differently because we cost more money, number one,\u201d Nicki Minaj\u2019s former manager Debra Antney told Vice in 2014. \u201cA guy could look like Cyclopes\u2019 twin and get up there and make it.

For us, it\u2019s the whole glam squad\u2014the hair, the makeup\u2014all these things that you have to have.\u201d\n\nThe whole thing just seems like a snake eating its own tail: you have to be professionally gorgeous to be a successful rapper, but then your gorgeousness apparently makes your male bosses want to have sex with you, and then that\u2019s bad for your career. Seems like a good way around this would be to see women rappers as actual artists with agency?",

        "content": "\u201cBachelor In Paradise\u201d contestant DeMario Jackson has been thrust into the spotlight ever since production was shut down on ABC\u2019s dating series, due to allegations of \u201cmisconduct\u201d that launched an ongoing investigation by Warner Bros. Television. Jackson is at the center of the scandal along with fellow contestant Corinne Olympios, amid tabloid reports about an inappropriate sexual encounter. Jackson broke his silence earlier this week, saying, \u201cMy character and family name has been assassinated this past week with false claims and malicious allegations.\u201d\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Variety, Jackson\u2019s lawyer Walter Mosley says his client has suffered because of the recent swirl of coverage.\n\n\u201cThis has caused a lot of trauma \u2014 both physical and emotional injury,\u201d says Mosley. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult for DeMario and his family. He\u2019s a celebrity for all the wrong reasons.\u201d\n\nMosley says his focus is on clearing his client\u2019s name, and then exploring any legal remedies. While he declined to say whether he will be taking legal action against the studio, network or Olympios, Mosley did say that a potential case may came after he views the footage from \u201cBachelor In Paradise,\u201d which neither he nor Jackson have yet seen. \u201cI have requested the tapes and I\u2019m hoping to see the tapes next week,\u201d he says. \u201cThe tapes are the real facts needed to vindicate DeMario\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nGiven the serious nature of the complaints, Mosley says he supports the investigation, but says he questions the process given that the tapes should provide a clear answer.\n\n\u201cAs a lawyer, oftentimes, you\u2019re in a case where it\u2019s a he-said-she-said and there are parties with conflicting stories, and every once in a while, you\u2019re gifted with a story that the entire thing is caught on camera,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is one of those rare occasions because they were shooting a reality television show. For 20 or 30 people to get it wrong or to miss something, for seasoned professionals over at Warner Bros. and ABC to get it wrong and for some third party who never saw the tape and who wasn\u2019t on set at the time of the incident to make an accusation \u2014 as a lawyer, it\u2019s like Christmas.\u201d\n\nOlympios, who hired attorney Marty Singer earlier this week, says she has \u201clittle memory\u201d of the night in question. \u201cAs a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality,\u201d she said in a statement earlier this week. Olympios\u2019 publicist Stan Rosenfield tells Variety, \u201cCorinne has not seen the tapes.\u201d\n\nMosley says he is \u201cnot at liberty\u201d to share Jackson\u2019s side of the story, but says \u201cthere\u2019s no criminal investigation and we don\u2019t fear any criminal investigation.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t say whether he has heard from Olympios\u2019 camp, but said, \u201cDeMario is not the big fish in this situation.\u201d\n\nMosley also declined to share Jackson\u2019s version of the night\u2019s events, but he did challenge the timeline. He pointed to Olympios\u2019 statement, which reads, \u201cI am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened the night of June 4,\u201d and explains that Jackson was not actually with Olympios during the \u201cnight.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mosley, Jackson\u2019s \u201cvery limited interaction\u201d with her happened around 5 p.m. \u201cThat\u2019s not at night \u2014 that\u2019s early evening,\u201d says Mosley. \u201cIf you read the account [in tabloids], they suggest that there were three other people who had similar hookups with Corinne throughout the night, after DeMario \u2014 none of which have been perceived like my client has, but those hookups would have happened at night.\u201d\n\nJackson\u2019s attorney would not say whether his client has been in touch with Olympios since the scandal broke, but says Jackson has her best interests in mind. \u201cHe has a great deal of respect for Corinne,\u201d Mosley says. \u201cThey were as friendly as castmates could be.\u201d\n\nBefore the \u201cBachelor In Paradise\u201d scandal, Jackson was portrayed as the villain on the current season of \u201cThe Bachelorette.\u201d A woman from his past was brought back on the show, and he was ultimately sent home.\n\nAsked if Jackson was put in a staged situation, Mosley says, \u201cI\u2019m sure if you asked him that, he\u2019d say they brought a girl from my past who I never knew and had a few text messages exchanged, but they paid her to come on and say that she\u2019s my girlfriend \u2014 she wasn\u2019t. But that\u2019s part of reality TV. You sign up for that, and that\u2019s the producers\u2019 job to find a girl that would come on and do that.\u201d\n\nMosley would not confirm whether Jackson lost his job this week, as has been reported, but says the combination of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d and \u201cBachelor In Paradise\u201d has \u201cseriously damaged\u201d his client\u2019s reputation, due to a series of \u201cmissteps.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a real joy working with DeMario. He\u2019s super smart, very witty, well educated, comes from a really great family,\u201d Mosley says. \u201cYou might read something or see him on \u2018The Bachelorette,\u2019 but the first thing about him is that he\u2019s just a good kid from a really good family. He has no record, has never been accused of anything like this, and no one that knows him would ever think he would be in this type of situation.\u201d",

Why?!'\"\n\n\"He kind of just went for it, and was like, so on the defense, and it's like, I was never mad at you or blaming you for anything!\" she continued, adding that she was \"nervous\" to reach out to Jackson after the scandal \"because he was talking to the media.\"\n\n\"I can't help but feel like he thought I thought that he did something to me,\" she guessed of why Jackson might have been so defensive. Olympios released a statement after the shutdown, in which herself as a \"victim.\"\n\nThe reality star, who also opened up about the incident on Tuesday's Good Morning America, insisted that she doesn't \"remember much\" of the circumstances that led to a producer filing a third party complaint of misconduct -- or the whole first day of Paradise.\n\n\"I definitely over-drank. I was also on some medication that you're not supposed to drink on, which I didn't know,\" she said. \"It can look like you're totally present and you're totally there, and your mind is just not anywhere near. It impairs your judgement. It completely unbalances you.\"\n\n\"Everyone thought that I was just having fun and being Corinne. There's no way for you guys to know. I don't think it's anyone's fault,\" she said of the events leading to the shutdown, admitting that Jackson in particular didn't do \"anything wrong\" and that the two were \"cordial\" the next day.\n\nOlympios did say, however, that she wished the situation \"could have been handled differently.\"\n\n\"It was hard for me to go through something like that too. The media wants to paint you a certain way that you know you're just not. It's just hard,\" she said. \"I really just want people to know that I don't blame DeMario. I never pointed fingers at DeMario. I never said a bad word about DeMario.\"\n\n\"I would want to tell him, 'I'm so sorry that you had to go through this, and I wish you all the best,'\" she shared. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nBachelor in Paradise airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.\n\nJackson sat down with ET earlier this month, where he revealed why he felt \"vindicated\" after the scandal -- and shared his own message for Olympios.

I was sore and it hurt to walk.\u201d\n\nThe next hearing in the case has been set for August 8.\n\nEarlier the model and entrepreneur appeared on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d with Bloom in an interview which aired Monday morning before the hearing.\n\nChyna told \u201cGMA\u201d she was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Kardashian\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cLike, this is a person I trusted,\u201d she said. \u201cI just felt\u2026betrayed.\u201d\n\nShe denied claims she engaged with the photos by liking some of the images her ex posted, saying she has Kardashian blocked on Instagram.\n\nShe said she decided to pursue legal action after speaking with her former love with whom she shares an eight-month-old daughter, Dream.\n\n\u201cThe moral of the story is he doesn\u2019t respect me,\u201d said Chyna, whose real name is Angela White. \u201cIf you can\u2019t respect me, you have to respect the law.\u201d\n\nBloom said on Friday she had filed for a temporary restraining order against Kardashian on behalf of her client.\n\nRelated: Lisa Bloom puts Rob Kardashian on notice over tirade against Blac Chyna\n\nCalifornia has laws regarding \u201crevenge porn\u201d in which a person can be charged for publicly releasing unauthorized nude images of another person to cause them emotional distress.\n\nThe former couple has had a tumultuous relationship that\u2019s been documented on both social media and their E! reality series \u201cRob & Chyna.\u201d\n\nThings were also complicated by the fact Chyna shares a son with rapper Tyga, who left her to begin dating Kardashian\u2019s younger sister, Kylie Jenner.\n\nOn Monday\u2019s \u201cGMA\u201d appearance, Bloom defended Chyna against those who say the reality star already exposes a great deal of herself in her own social media postings.\n\n\u201cAny explicit photos that she may have chosen to post in the past that\u2019s her choice,\u201d Bloom said. \u201cThis is like saying that a woman can\u2019t be raped if she previously chose to have sex with someone. It\u2019s her body, it\u2019s her choice,each and every time.\u201d\n\nChyna said she and Kardashian split in December and there is absolutely no hope of a reconciliation. She said she has not heard from any of his family members since Kardashian\u2019s social media postings last Wednesday.\n\nChyna addressed speculation that she got pregnant as a revenge ploy against the Kardashians or to get money out of the reality mogul family, Chyna denied it.\n\n\u201cI was already Blac Chyna before the Kardsahians,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "0\n\nThe Epix drama series Berlin Station is back for Season 2, as the Far Right tide is sweeping across Europe while Germany is in the midst of a pivotal election. And with Alt-Right party leader Katerina Gerhardt captivating disillusioned voters fed up with the status quo, the team at Berlin Station must determine the nature and level of the threat that she poses and what they should do about it.\n\nDuring this 1-on-1 interview with Collider, actress Ashley Judd (who plays the new Chief of Station, BB Yates) talked about what drew her to Berlin Station and this character, how her TED Talk led them to want to cast her, crashing the boy\u2019s club, finding a balance between acting and her humanitarian work, and loving action. She also talked about what a pleasure it was to be a part of Twin Peaks: The Return, and to work with David Lynch and Richard Beymer.\n\nCollider: How did you come to Season 2 of Berlin Station? What was it that drew you to the show?\n\nASHLEY JUDD: My manager reached out to me and said that the good folks at Epix had a very special show with an incredibly strong ensemble cast, and that the show was very smart. She said that they had watched my TED Talk and they wanted me to play BB Yates, who would be the boss of the CIA in Germany. I loved the idea, instantly, particularly when I watched Season 1 and saw what a strong actor and character Valerie Edwards is and the fact that, in the second season, Esther Krug would be the head of German intelligence. I think that the show looks like what the 21st century should be, in terms of gender parity in the workplace. So, when you have all of us together, augmented with Keke [Palmer], it\u2019s phenomenal. I\u2019m 49 and Michelle [Forbes] is 52, and that\u2019s fantastic. I think that audiences are going to love it.\n\nHow is BB Yates received by the boy\u2019s club of being in a profession like this?\n\nJUDD: Another thing that appealed to me was learning that, as the season evolved, I would continue to be crashing the boy\u2019s club. My nemesis is the U.S. Ambassador, who\u2019s a political appointee. He\u2019s not someone with a background in diplomacy from the state department. He\u2019s someone who\u2019s violating the traditional boundary between the White House and the CIA. With BB leaving, the CIA becomes a place of resistance, so it adds to the intrigue.\n\nHave you ever had someone want to cast you because of your TED Talk before this?\n\nJUDD: It affirmed to me that they want me for exactly who and what I am. I\u2019ve been acting now for a little over 20 years and I have a body of work that accurately expresses what I\u2019m capable of doing, Paramount has been a studio home for me since Kiss the Girls, so there are many reasons why I could be an obvious choice, but I have all of my international travel with my humanitarian work and I\u2019m a PhD student at University of California Berkeley. For them to say, \u201cOh, we love Ashley! Let\u2019s look at her TED Talk and see how that energy fits with BB,\u201d was just absolutely delightful. It\u2019s an example of, how I do something is how I do everything. There doesn\u2019t have to be a false separation between my advocacy voice and how I show up in my acting.\n\nBecause you do so much outside of acting, is it hard to find acting roles that get you excited enough to want to take time away from the other work that you do, or do you like to have a balance?\n\nJUDD: I like the balance. I loved working on Twin Peaks. Mr. Lynch called and said that he\u2019d written something for me, which was a wonderful compliment and seemed like it would be really fun. And then, I did a movie about human trafficking (called Trafficked), that came out in October. I was in India for the month of March. I was in Jordan, working with Syrian refugees, before India. I\u2019ve also been to the war zone in eastern Ukraine. So, I have a very balanced and full life, and acting will always, God willing, be a part of that life \u2018cause I love it.\n\nDo the worlds that you work in \u2013 acting and humanitarian \u2013 feel very different?\n\nJUDD: Berlin Station has wet my appetite for acting again. I\u2019m more open-minded now about scripts than I was, over the past couple of years, when I was really hunkered down pretty exclusively in the humanitarian work. Acting is very joyful for me. The process is draining and time consuming, but the acting itself is really joyful.\n\nHave you had fun doing some of the more physical roles that you\u2019ve done?\n\nJUDD: I love that! I made sure that I told them right away, on Berlin Station as I did on Missing, that I would love to be able to fight. I love to fight.\n\nAre you able to get out in the field and do that, this season?\n\nJUDD: There\u2019s a little bit, but I\u2019m running the station, making it all happen. So far, I haven\u2019t had a chance to do a big fight scene.\n\nAs the person who has to come in to run things, how does everybody else react to her?\n\nJUDD: Well, there\u2019s always workplace relationships, and some are more straightforward than others. Part of what\u2019s so nice about the work with Keke is that I mentor her and it\u2019s a strong female-to-female alliance.\n\nHow was it to work on Twin Peaks with Richard Beymer, who was there from the beginning?\n\nJUDD: It was super cool. He\u2019s such a lovely man. Of course, I asked Mr. Lynch what the humming sound was, and he said, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t tell you that!\u201d\n\nBerlin Station airs on Sunday nights on Epix.",

The mother-to-be, who\u2019s currently in Cleveland where her baby daddy Tristan Thompson is based, is expected to give birth any day now, and we\u2019ve just learned who\u2019s going to be in the delivery room. \u201cKhloe is loving her pregnancy, but she\u2019s even more excited to become a mom, which will happen sooner than you think. She\u2019s only days away from birth, maybe a week or two at the most, at least that is what she is hoping. She plans on giving birth in Ohio, rather than Beverly Hills like her sisters, to make it easier for Tristan to be with her for the birth,\u201d a source close to the KUWTK star tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. So exciting, right?\n\nBecause of Tristan\u2019s busy basketball schedule, Khloe decided to relocate to Cleveland, but that isn\u2019t stopping her famous family and friends from joining her on the special day. \u201cMalika [Haqq] is set to be with Khloe all along the way as will grandma Kris [Jenner] and some of Tristan\u2019s family too.

Throughout her pregnancy, she\u2019s been super open about her cravings, favorite moments, and even fears. As we previously told you, Khloe got super candid about breastfeeding after a fan told her to \u201cenjoy the pregnancy boobs\u201d on March 26. \u201cOh my gosh lol I\u2019m nervous about breastfeeding. I hear crazy things, but I\u2019ll fight through it and love it,\u201d Khloe replied. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s ready for motherhood, and we know she\u2019ll be fantastic!",

Suited and booted was how it was done on the daily. Seats on a plane were spacious, the food was real, the lines manageable. Eye contact was mandatory, and a handshake was as stiff as the drinks that were served.\n\nAnd then\u2014oil, terror, dollars and cents\u2014times changed. Nothing personifies the anxiety-inducing madness of modern air travel like an international terminal. This is why we need Xanax and Ambien over pretzels and peanuts.\n\nThe American airport is a case study of the herd mentality, where waiting and woe have replaced whimsical and wishful. Nothing works, no one cares, and nothing seems to improve security or efficiency despite pre-checks and precautions. Footwear to laptops and lithium\u2014we\u2019re all resigned to our fate when flying, just hoping not to get too fucked over from point A to B. Nostalgia be damned, some things were better before the age of apps, and traveling was one of them. Flying was special.\n\nAnd now, for the most elite of the jet set, it is again. In May, the first private terminal in the U.S. opened at Los Angeles International Airport. Private is the operative word; the $22 million facility is located on the far side of the airport, away from public terminals and paparazzi. There are 13 suites with bathrooms, drinks, food, televisions, and a staff of eight servants\u2014er, attendants.\n\nCourtesy of Gavin de Becker & Associates.\n\nPassengers complete security screening and clear customs in the terminal before being driven, head-of-state style, across the runway to the plane in a BMW 7 Series sedan (supposedly just 70 steps from terminal to plane. The average Joe hoofs more than 2,000).\n\nModeled on Heathrow\u2019s Windsor Suite, which runs about $3,500 for membership, V.I.P. terminals are catching on, with one in Dubai that opened last December, and options in Amsterdam, Munich, and now Los Angeles, where the chosen few no longer deal with luggage, lines, or paparazzi. Could anything be more celebrity-friendly in a city known for stars?\n\nV.I.P. is a descriptor so casually thrown around these days that any place with burgundy velvet and a bald bouncer can call itself \u201cexclusive.\u201d But the LAX private terminal is crammed with tangible reminders of how different the other half lives. Organic seaweed snacks, 85 percent cacao, Laurent-Perrier Champagne, scented candles, daybeds. Passengers can take advantage of seemingly every toiletterie and travel hack under the sun, from universal chargers and noise-canceling headphones to Emergen-C and roll-on deodorant. Instead of rushing to the gate and jockeying for a seat, the biggest problem in this terminal is figuring out whether there is any Dijon mustard (there is), and how to switch from CNN to MSNBC on the suite\u2019s TV.\n\nTop right, Gavin de Becker & Associates. Bottom and left, courtesy of Adam Popescu\n\nDuring a visit to the terminal in June I met the suite\u2019s designer, Gavin de Becker\u2014sort of. I was led to an empty room, and a James Bond-esque live tablet. De Becker, 63, with jet-black hair, sharp eyes even across a screen, and wearing what looked like a very comfortable kimono, was calling across the Pacific from Tokyo.\n\n\u201cWhat others have missed,\u201d he began, \u201cis that this is for business travelers. This isn\u2019t luxury. This is logistics. You can park your car and leave it, book spa services, doctors, order food in advance, everything you could get in the terminal, without having to carry bags, walking to a gate change or avoiding lines.\u201d",

The claims made in the article seem exaggerated or invented for attention-grabbing purposes. For example, Kanye West's plan to go off the grid and write \"killer bars\" because he didn't make a list seems like a convenient excuse to justify his actions rather than a genuine motivation.\n3. The source quoted in the article is an unnamed insider who provides dubious information about Kanye West's motivations and emotions. This lack of transparency and accountability makes it difficult to verify the accuracy of the claims.\n4.

Netflix has heard the call, but the decision remains.\n\n\u201cTo our Sense8 family\u2026We\u2019ve seen the petitions. We\u2019ve read the messages. We know you want to #RenewSense8,\u201d said the streamer in a message posted to the show\u2019s official Facebook page. \u201cWe wish we could #BringBackSense8 for you. The reason we\u2019ve taken so long to get back to you is because we\u2019ve thought long and hard here at Netflix to try to make it work but unfortunately we can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe message was signed with the hashtag #SensatesForever: \u201cThank you for watching and hope you\u2019ll stay close with your cluster around the world.\u201d\n\nCo-star Brian J. Smith, who had helped to circulate the #RenewSense8 movement when rumors of the cancellation first began to circulate, also posted his own lengthy letter to fans in hopes of further giving them peace about Netflix\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cSince you\u2019ve been so extraordinarily passionate,\u201d he began, \u201cI feel it\u2019s only fair that you get more than lip service or a silly tweet from me.\u201d The actor, who makes up one of the eight starring \u201csensates\u201d who are part of the show\u2019s \u201ccluster,\u201d said he was given the same reason for cancellation that viewers were: viewership. \u201cIt may not seem fair in the face of such passionate fan backlash, but it always, ALWAYS boils down to numbers.\n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m aware there is no shady court intrigue that contributed to Netflix\u2019s decision, and I know that a lot of very smart people had to reach a consensus in order to pull the plug on a show that they had already invested an insane amount of capital in, even if that meant the story would never get an ending,\u201d he writes. \u201cI think the saddest part of finishing a show this way is knowing that future audiences will never pick up a story they know has no resolution. It\u2019s seems like such a waste.\u201d\n\nNetflix canceled Sense8 shortly after canceling Baz Luhrmann\u2019s The Get Down \u2014 two of its most expensive series. Though the streamer does not reveal ratings information, the Sense8 news came one day after Netflix founder and CEO Reed Hastings said the streamer should be taking more risk with its content and have a higher cancellation rate. He counted the breakout success of 13 Reasons Why as an example.\n\nSense8, hailed for its inclusiveness, was an ambitious offering from creators Lana and Lilly Wachowski and J. Michael Straczynski that came with a big budget, as the series shot around the world. The series filmed in 13 countries during its two-season run to tell the stories of eight global strangers who find themselves to be emotionally and mentally connected. The ensemble cast was made up of Toby Onwumere, Doona Bae, Jamie Clayton, Tina Desai, Tuppence Middleton, Max Riemelt, Miguel Angel Silvestre and Smith.\n\nRead Smith\u2019s full note below:\n\nI just wanted to take a moment to personally thank all of you for the love and support and fight you\u2019ve put up the last week or so. In the wake of such bad news it was heartening to know that what Sense8 stood for meant so much to so many people.\n\nAnd since you\u2019ve been so extraordinarily passionate I feel it\u2019s only fair that you get more than lip service or a silly tweet from me.\n\nGuys, there are no secrets here. I\u2019ve been given the same reason for the cancelation that you have: viewership. As far as I\u2019m aware there is no shady court intrigue that contributed to Netflix\u2019s decision, and I know that a lot of very smart people had to reach a consensus in order to pull the plug on a show that they had already invested an insane amount of capital in, even if that meant the story would never get an ending. I think the saddest part of finishing a show this way is knowing that future audiences will never pick up a story they know has no resolution. It\u2019s seems like such a waste.\n\nHowever \u2013\n\nDo you remember when I tweeted on May 30, in response to a fan\u2019s concern that the show might get canceled, \u201cThis might be a good time to start making some noise\u201d? I had a pretty clear idea by that point that Netflix had made their move, and I also knew from previous experience that once a cancellation is announced there is no going back. It is absolutely final, and the fans are left feeling helpless and angry. I stepped out of my lane and preempted the official announcement because you, our cluster, deserved to have your voices heard. And you came roaring back in a way I wasn\u2019t expecting. It was beyond awesome. I guarantee you, you were seen and you were heard.\n\nPlease know that the fight you all put up in trying to save something that you loved will forever be the \u201cfinal season\u201d of Sense8. YOU have given the show the ending it deserved. Even if that fight didn\u2019t have a happy ending, it meant something. Don\u2019t ever forget that.\n\nOur Netflix producers Peter, Cindy and Tara were fans of the show from day one. They partied with us, encouraged us, supported us unconditionally. I do not envy the position they are in here. Netflix is a relatively young enterprise and these kinds of growing pains suck. But please remember that they made this strange, gorgeous, unconventional show possible in the first place, and the show would have continued if only the viewership justified the expense. It may not seem fair in the face of such passionate fan backlash, but it always, ALWAYS boils down to numbers.\n\nThere is no anger or bitterness in my heart. This boy from Texas got to see the world, got to work with the Wachowskis and that amazing cast and crew, many of whom are lifelong friends; got to meet so many of you. I think you can tell that I\u2019ve grown a lot as an actor between seasons one and two. That\u2019s all I could ever want out of this experience. The rest is gravy.\n\nYou can all rest easy knowing that even though the show won\u2019t continue you\u2019ve made a difference. You put up a good, hell no, a friggen GREAT fight. I will forever consider Sense8 to be a kind of Unfinished Symphony, a reminder to never take the things we love for granted. I\u2019m going to miss the show and I\u2019m going to miss Gorski, but I\u2019m going forward and I\u2019m never going to be the same.\n\nThank you all from the bottom of my heart.",

        "content": "The Voice features a rotating group of celebrity coaches mentoring up-and-coming talent. Gwen Stefani has played a big part in the show, coaching three seasons: Season 7, Season 9, and most recently Season 12. Her presence on The Voice extends beyond just coaching though. She's performed solo, mentored, and even did a duet with her boyfriend and fellow coach Blake Shelton. So, suffice to say, fans were surprised to hear she wouldn't be returning for Season 13, despite her popularity on the program. So, why isn't Gwen Stefani coaching The Voice Season 13? (Bustle reached out to NBC and Stefani's rep for comment, but has not yet received a response.)\n\nThis isn't Stefani's first time stepping away from her red spinning chair; she took a hiatus after Season 9, only to return for Season 12. At the time she took the break, Stefani told Extra she wanted to focus on her career. The Season 9-12 timeout had a clear purpose to it, she wanted to focus on making music and performing. Stefani's reasons for leaving this time are a little less defined, although the multi-night live show is a big commitment for already busy stars.\n\nMinus Stefani, the coaches for Season 13 are Shelton, Adam Levine, Miley Cyrus, and Jennifer Hudson. And, for now, Stefani is keeping busy with music and performances. Stefani is releasing a Christmas duet with Shelton Oct. 6 and is promoting the jingle on her Instagram.\n\nStefani's love for Shelton is as strong as ever, even without The Voice, and she's been promoting his upcoming album on her social media. In February of 2017, Stefani went on Late Night With Seth Meyers and talked about their musical and romantic unity saying, \"It's so unbelievable ... I love Blake, he's just the most incredible guy. Like, everybody loves Blake ... he's just a sparkly, happy, amazing person.\"\n\nAccording to Stefani's social media, she's also continued to perform her music around the world. She posted the below Instagram on Sept. 15, preforming her classic hit \"Hollaback Girl\" in Korea. She's a seasoned performer and any time not spent coaching on The Voice will likely be spent doing concerts at home and abroad. While The Voice platform is large, the coaches are all successful outside the show as well.\n\nAnd, maybe Stefani will return for a future season. It's not like she'll stop being involved with The Voice since Shelton remains a coach. Hopefully the opportunity to coach new talent, the fun she seems to have on the program, and the fans will draw her back in at a future time \u2014 it's happened before when she left after Season 9 but came back for 12. And, ET reported in May of 2017 that Stefani would love to return to The Voice, but that her future on the show was uncertain. \"I don't have any plans to come back,\" she told the outlet. \"I love being here; I'd love to come back. We'll see what happens next.\"\n\nThe new season of The Voice airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on NBC. New coaches Cyrus and Hudson should inject a new energy into the program, which will be anchored by longtime coaches Shelton and Levine. And, Hudson not only was a contestant on American Idol, she also was a Voice coach on the UK version of The Voice UK Season 6. So, she has plenty of experience to take Stefani's spot.\n\nThe Voice has remained a strong competition show because of its ability to mix things up. Hopefully, the shake-ups continue in the future and put Stefani back in a chair \u2014 because going too long without her would be bananas, b-a-n-a-n-a-s.",

She's been consistently churning out some of 2017's best songs, rebounding in a big way after her breakup with The Weeknd, recovering from a life saving surgery, and now she's performing at the American Music Awards as if she hasn't just undergone a truly insane few months. NOT A BIG DEAL. Selena Gomez's 2017 AMAs performance proves this woman can do anything, no matter what life throws at her.\n\nJust when we all thought it was all \"Bad Liar\" music video parties and \"Fetish\" sexy-times for Gomez, we found out that, JK!, she's actually undergone a kidney transplant procedure in the middle of simultaneously pushing her new music to the masses. Talk about intense.\n\nGomez revealed in early September that her best friend Francia Raisa donated her kidney to help save her life, which came as a huge shock to her fans. While Gomez was busy laying low in recovery, the public was oblivious to her situation and soaking up hit after hit. We were just low-key getting down with our bad selves to her new, sultry and sexy tracks.\n\nThen in early October, more shocking news broke that her ten month relationship with The Weeknd had ended, and fans started freaking out all over again. First of all, now everything we've thought to be true about love and relationships feels like a lie, and second... SELENA, ARE YOU OK?\n\nYes, guy. Yes she is. Tonight's performance proves it.\n\nGomez stepped (rolled) onto the stage and sang her heart out to her new hit, \"Wolves.\" The song was in collaboration with DJ Marshmello, and the performance was true fire. This is the first time Gomez has performed since announcing her kidney transplant, and she expertly maneuvered the stage looking as fierce as ever. The audience went crazy for her. While we've had the audio to \"Wolves\" for a little bit of time now, watching her perform it was a totally different animal. (No pun intended.) (Just kidding. Pun intended.)\n\nFans were also keeping their eyes peeled for glimpses of her on-again boyfriend Justin Bieber, who had four AMA nominations himself. Biebs was nominated twice for Collaboration of the Year, and again in categories Favorite Song \u2014 Pop/Rock for \"Despacito\" and Favorite Rap/Hip-hop for his song \"I'm The One.\"\n\nOf course, viewers were dying to see Bieber's face when Gomez stepped out on stage in hopes it would finally confirm to the public that they're back together. Earlier this week, photos surfaced of the couple kissing at one of Bieber's hockey games, so we can only imagine that they're 100 percent back on.\n\nHonestly, it looks like their relationship is the real deal and Gomez is giving him another chance. An insider told People magazine,\n\nJustin was Selena\u2019s first love. He will always have a special place in her heart. She\u2019s always held out hope that one day the circumstances and timing would be right.\n\nAnd it's no surprise Justin has wanted her back all along. The source added,\n\nSpending time together makes them both very happy. For Justin, no one ever came close to comparing to Selena. He always thought she was the most special and now seems mature enough to realize Selena deserves the best.\n\nHell yeah, she does.\n\nIf tonight's performance is any indication, she is feeling better than ever and we can't wait to see what 2018 brings for the pop princess and her love life.\n\nCheck out the entire Gen Why series and other videos on Facebook and the Bustle app across Apple TV, Roku, and Amazon Fire TV.",

        "content": "We didn\u2019t even have to watch the Revenge Body premiere last night to know there are serious problems with Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2019s new show. But watch we did, and let\u2019s just say we\u2019re not impressed with the reality TV star\u2019s latest endeavor. They say the best revenge is living well\u2014not losing weight. But Kardashian spun the more than 40 pounds she shed after breaking up with ex-husband Lamar Odom into not just a term\u2014\u201drevenge body\u201d\u2014but a TV show. And the results are appalling.\n\nAt the start of the show, you hear a voiceover, led by Kardashian: \u201cThis revenge body, who is it for?\u201d Three contestants answer: \u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9.\u201d \u201cMy mom.\u201d \u201cMy friends.\u201d Then you hear Kardashian say, \u201cHaters are our greatest motivators.\u201d To which we say: A resounding no. Here, we list the top five reasons why you should boycott Kardashian\u2019s new show.\n\n\ud83d\udc7a 1. Weight Loss Should Not Be About Revenge\n\nIf you choose to lose weight, it should be about fulfilling your own personal health goals\u2014not about fulfilling some sort of fantasy to \u201cshow\u201d people in your life something. If you\u2019re going to show anyone anything, you should just live your best life. What\u2019s more, the idea that \u201chaters\u201d should be our greatest motivators is so twisted, because if one is using the imagined idea of someone else\u2019s perception as a gauge for personal growth, the scale is pretty much guaranteed to come out skewed.\n\nPlus, Kardashian herself said that she began to work out as a method of stress relief, which, according to her, had nothing to do with losing weight. \u201cI started working out during my divorce, but it was more for sanity reasons,\u201d she told ET.\n\nIn 2013, Kardashian \u201cdecided to turn to fitness as a form of therapy and as a stress reliever,\u201d as she wrote on Instagram. \u201cI started slow and eventually I started working out four to five days a week,\u201d she said. That all sounds good: It\u2019s been proven that exercise can lead to happiness, and there are tons of studies on the effect of physical movement on one\u2019s overall well-being.\n\nBut this is a far cry from the spectacle into which she\u2019s spun her enjoyment of exercise. It\u2019s one thing to use moderate exercise as an outlet during a breakup\u2014anything that helps ground oneself in times of chaos is good. \u201cGenerally speaking, the strategy of doubling down on self-care in response to a break up is a good one,\u201d eating disorder specialist Tabitha Limotte, LMFT, CEDS, tells us. \u201cHowever, that means \u2018self-care\u2019 in a much broader sense, and with the goals of exerting some control over our life and self-improvement, not revenge.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc7a 2. The Show Is All About Getting Thin\u2014Not Healthy\n\nKardashian has been sharing some seriously problematic \u201cbefore and after\u201d photos on Instagram leading up to the premiere. For example, in the image on the above left, Kardashian looks perfectly healthy\u2014there\u2019s no reason for her to seek weight loss. But instead, she began working out and obtained what she calls a \u201crevenge body,\u201d which she shows off on the right.\n\nThe issue with channeling one\u2019s attention into revenge\u2014and, even more troubling, into molding one\u2019s body into severely skewed societal standards around what bodies \u201cshould\u201d look like as a vehicle toward such a goal\u2014is that it can be extremely unhealthy, and it just doesn\u2019t work, at least not in the long-term.\n\n\u201cThe real problem in focusing on our bodies, and on revenge, is that both lend themselves to obsessive behavior,\u201d notes Limotte. \u201cThat might make great television, but is not a viable strategy for coping with loss and rejection. The best medicine for that is time, self-discovery, and understanding our relationship patterns so that we are less likely to repeat them.\u201d Yeah, no one is talking about any of that on Revenge Body, that\u2019s for sure.\n\n\ud83d\udc7a 3. It\u2019s Horribly Exploitative\n\nIn the first few minutes of the show, cameras watch a young man named Will binge-eating Chinese takeout and a chocolate cake alone in his apartment, then sitting shirtless on his bed, looking sad. Then, cut to a snuggle with a huge teddy bear. The shots are voyeuristic and parasitic, clearly reveling in this \u201cinside look\u201d\u2014and completely unnecessary for the storyline of the show. This is plain-old exploitation at its finest, and we can just hear some TV exec saying, \u201cDo we have a giant stuffed animal somewhere? Can we get that on screen?\u201d And so begins an hour of extremely disturbing television.\n\nSure, some may argue that he and his fellow cohort signed up for this, and sign up they did. But people will volunteer to do literally anything if it\u2019ll be televised\u2014see Born in the Wild and Dating Naked\u2014especially if a Kardashian is involved. \u201cIt was one of those moments that you\u2019ll never forget in your life, because it\u2019s Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian,\u201d Will says in an on-screen confessional of meeting the reality star.\n\nAs to why Will joined the show: \u201cMy boyfriend, Kyle, broke up with me, and I want him back so bad,\u201d he told Kardashian. \u201cI really want to lose all this weight, so maybe I can get him back \u2026 He told me, straight to my face, he wasn\u2019t attracted to me anymore.\u201d Kardashian\u2019s response: \u201cMmm,\u201d telegraphing her best concerned face.\n\n\ud83d\udc7a 4. This Kind of Exercise Can Lead to Obsession and Eating Disorders\n\nRevenge Body certainly isn\u2019t the first TV show to follow a bunch of people working out in the hopes of losing weight. (Those other shows have their own problems.) But it is the first one to make the process about revenge\u2014the people on this show aren\u2019t motivated to hit the gym for health reasons, though that may play into their decision. They\u2019re getting their sweat on for the express purpose of making someone else feel bad.\n\nIf you start a revenge-based workout plan, it can lead to obsessive exercise. \u201cIf the exercise becomes obsessive, it can lead to life-threatening health consequences,\u201d says Limotte, noting those can include physical injury and \u201cpsychological impairment.\u201d There\u2019s even a condition associated with this phenomenon\u2014\u201dovertraining syndrome\u201d\u2014which looks like \u201cdepression, irritability, and increased anxiety and guilt around not exercising,\u201d adds Limotte. \u201cOver-exercise can also lead to the development of an eating disorder, which is a serious illness that often persists for many years.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc7a 5. Exercise Should Be About Health\u2014and Moderation\n\nEpisode 1 of Revenge Body is the first and last installment of the series we plan to watch. And as far as Limotte is concerned, when in doubt, slow your roll. \u201cI recommend Churchill\u2019s principal of economy of effort: Why exercise for two hours when 30 minutes will suffice?\u201d\n\nKardashian\u2019s last show, Kocktails with Khlo\u00e9, had an unfortunate name and was pretty lackluster, but at least it was benign. When it was, uh, kanceled, no one was exactly surprised, but perhaps we all should\u2019ve paid a little more attention to the fact that Kardashian was apparently pining to focus her attention on \u201cother jobs,\u201d according to a source via TMZ when Kocktails was shut down. Now we know what those \u201cother jobs\u201d entail, and now we\u2019re pining\u2014for earlier days of Kardashian TV.",

Next, Tom Hiddleston, similarly decked out in knock-off apparel and a bad wig, walked on stage to raucous applause. That wasn\u2019t all, however, as Cate Blanchett, who stars as Hela, Goddess of Death in the film, showed up with an array of pipe cleaners on her back, fashioned to imitate the horns of her character.\n\n\u201cI think those poor people just want to watch the movie,\u201d Blanchett said in a taped interview backstage.\n\nThe opening scene done, Jeff Goldblum, who plays the Grandmaster in the film, made an entrance on a scooter to introduce his \u201cgrand champion,\u201d Mark Ruffalo, who, of course, was dressed in a cheap Hulk costume with green, rubber fists.\n\nHemsworth and Ruffalo battled their way through the crowded theater that preluded a \u201cbrief, 45-minute intermission,\u201d as announced by Corden.\n\nWhen the show returned, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Hiddleston and Tessa Thompson squared off against Blanchett and her \u201cferocious guard dog\u201d \u2014 a stuffed huskie dog. \u201cAnd they all lived happily ever after\u2026until the next Thor movie,\u201d Corden narrated.\n\nBackstage, the actors celebrated. \u201cThor: Ragnarok 4D gets 10 Goldblums out of a possible 10 Goldblums.

Each seat filled, and some guests had to stand along the back wall and sit on the steps. The class was called the Business of Entertainment, Media and Sports. The students were there to interrogate Paltrow about Goop, her lifestyle-and-wellness e-commerce business, and to learn how to create a \u201csustainable competitive advantage,\u201d according to the class catalog.\n\nShe moved to the teacher\u2019s desk, where she sat down and crossed her legs. She talked about why she started the business, how she only ever wanted to be someone who recommended things. When she was in Italy, on the set of \u201cThe Talented Mr. Ripley,\u201d she\u2019d ask someone on the crew about, say, where the best gelato was. When she was in London, on the set of \u201cShakespeare in Love,\u201d she asked a crew member where to find the best coffee; in Paris, she asked an extra where to find the best bikini wax; in Berlin, the massage you can\u2019t miss. She wasn\u2019t just curious. She was planning this the whole time.\n\nThe first iteration of the company was only these lists \u2014 where to go and what to buy once you get there \u2014 via a newsletter she emailed out of her kitchen, the first one with recipes for turkey rag\u00f9 and banana-nut muffins. One evening, at a party in London, one of the newsletter\u2019s recipients, a venture capitalist named Juliet de Baubigny, told her, \u201cI love what you\u2019re doing with Goop.\u201d G.P., as she is called by nearly everyone in her employ, didn\u2019t even know what a venture capitalist was. She was using off-the-shelf newsletter software. But De Baubigny became a \u201cgodmother\u201d to Paltrow, she said. She encouraged her vision and \u201cgave permission\u201d to start thinking about how to monetize it.\n\nAt first, Goop \u2014 so named not just for her initials and for, you know, goop, but because someone along the way told her that all the successful internet companies had double O\u2019s \u2014 appealed to an audience that admired G.P.\u2019s rarefied lifestyle.

And then she went on to raise what she apparently considers to be the burning question here: Are women who are getting harassed \u2018asking for it'?\"\n\nAfter playing a clip of the comments \u2014 for which Karan has since apologized, telling the Associated Press they are \"not representative of how I feel or what I believe\" \u2014 Kelly turned the focus to her interview with one of Weinstein's accusers, TV journalist Lauren Sivan, who on Monday's episode told Kelly about her \"disgusting\" experience with Weinstein. \"Weirdly, I never thought to ask Lauren whether her skirt brought on that [restuarant] vestibule incident because her outfit is totally irrelevant \u2014 and most rational people know that,\" said Kelly.\n\nQuestioning Karan's statement, Kelly challenged her \"wrong\" thinking: \"There are laws in this country. Laws. I don't give a damn if a woman shows up in a bikini to the office. That doesn't invite or make it okay for her superior to harass her. It makes it okay for her boss to say, \u2018Go home and change.' That's it. The truth is sexual harassment has nothing to do with wardrobe; it has to do with power and control and sexual proclivities that a superior chooses not to reign in. How insulting, by the way, to men, as well? Like they are a bunch of animals who cannot behave themselves if a woman shows part of her thigh, right? This attitude of blaming women for their own harassment is actually one of the reasons women choose not to come forward after they get harassed because they fear victim shaming.\"\n\nKelly continued: \"How about we not pile on, Donna? How about we use this moment to encourage women to find their own voices, despite the risks and to stand up for themselves \u2014 which is hard enough, without rich, powerful, well-connected fashion moguls lecturing them on their fashion choices.\"\n\nThen came Kelly's kicker: \"And speaking of fashion choices, here's one for you: I'm done with Donna Karan.\"\n\nDespite her dismissive message, Kelly invited Karan on the show for \"an honest discussion about how [Karan] really feels,\" adding, \"If she's really sorry, if she really was taken out of context, if she really doesn't believe that way, explain those comments.\"\n\nWith her comments Tuesday, Kelly joined a growing list of celebrities speaking out against Weinstein, whose scandal erupted following an Oct. 5 New York Times expos\u00e9 alleging the movie mogul has been sexually harassing women for three decades. Weinstein has since been fired by The Weinstein Company and apologized for \"the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past\" in a statement to the Times. On Tuesday, a report posted by the New Yorker alleged more sexual misconduct claims, including assault, against Weinstein, which he also denied.\n\nWatch Kelly's segment in the video above.

Four of the accusers are Franco\u2019s former acting students. The majority of the accusations allege Franco pressured women into appearing nude on film sets.\n\n\u201cI feel there was an abuse of power, and there was a culture of exploiting non-celebrity women, and a culture of women being replaceable,\u201d Sarah Tither-Kaplan told the Times about Franco\u2019s set.\n\nTither-Kaplan was acting in Franco\u2019s film \u201cThe Long Home\u201d when she was asked by a producer to appear in a \u201cbonus scene\u201d that included a simulated orgy. The actress agreed to appear fully nude in the background of the scene, but she says she observed Franco allegedly remove clear plastic guards that covered actresses\u2019 vaginas \u201cto simulate the sex act with no protection.\u201d\n\nAnother woman, Violet Paley, says Franco pressured her into performing oral sex on him while sitting in her car in 2016.

When she did arrive, joining the students gathered around his impromptu memorial, it was more shocking than a slushie facial.\n\n\"Before Finn, I used to sing alone,\" she told the glee club before delivering the episode's most poignant performance, Bob Dylan's \"Make You Feel My Love.\"\n\nNothing was more gut-wrenching than when she told Matthew Morrison's Mr. Schue, \"He was my person.\"\n\nThen she handed him a plaque she'd had made, featuring a picture and quote from her \"untraditionally smart\" boyfriend that read, \"The show must go on. All over the place ... or something like that.\"\n\nAnd \"Glee\" did just that with its tribute, deftly balancing heartache with humor and respect, from its opening number (the black-clad cast singing \"Seasons of Love\" from Broadway's \"Rent\") to the closing scene: Will Schuester sobbing in Emma's (Jayma Mays) arms.\n\nMr. Schue urged the glee clubbers early in the show to memorialize Finn \"the only way we know how \u2014 by singing.\"\n\nThose performances included Mercedes' (Amber Riley) rendition of The Pretenders' \"I'll Stand By You,\" after thanking the sports stud for being the\"first cool kid to be nice to us.\" Sam (Chord Overstreet) and Artie (Kevin McHale) did a duet of James Taylor's \"Fire & Rain,\" Puck (Mark Salling) strummed his guitar along to Bruce Springsteen's \"No Surrender.\"\n\nAnd Santana (Naya Rivera) sang most of The Band Perry's \"If I Die Young\" \u2014 before fleeing the classroom, crying and screaming.\n\nShe also lashed out at Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), calling the new principal (!) a \"cold-hearted b----\" before shoving her into a cabinet.\n\nSue was characteristically callous about Finn's death \u2014 at first. \"I'm grieving. And I grieve by insulting those who mean the most to me,\" she explained.\n\nShe also ridiculed the students' memorials, saying, \"We honor Finn Hudson by ... not making a self-serving spectacle of our own sadness.\"\n\nKurt's memorial \u2014 planting a tree \u2014 was vandalized by Puck, who was also accused of swiping Finn's letterman jacket. (One of the episode's biggest tearjerkers was Kurt saying that Finn walking down his hallway in that jacket \"was like Superman had arrived.\u201d)\n\nOf course, the actual culprit was Mr. Schue, who, until the last scene of the episode, hadn't shed a tear since finding out about Finn's death.\n\nBut he made up for it in the end, weeping as he clutched Finn's jacket, the symbol of a shining star that dimmed much too soon.",

The contributions come from author proceeds and from the publisher, Simon & Schuster.\n\nBooks can take years from conception to publication, but \u201cWhose Boat Is This Boat?\u201d was essentially written in 24 hours and within six weeks was already on shelves, physical and virtual. It began after Trump visited New Bern, North Carolina, and was preoccupied with a yacht that had landed in a resident\u2019s backyard.\n\n\u201cTo see what we\u2019re seeing \u2014 this boat. I don\u2019t know what happened, but this boat just came here,\u201d he said.

It\u2019s a great achievement being on this highly competitive list for six weeks, including a week at No. 1, and we wish Stephen were happier about it.\u201d\n\nColbert said the book is for \u201cchildren of all ages,\u201d one that appeals to kids because it\u2019s \u201cpretty to look at, no nudity, no violence\u201d and one that shows adults how \u201cour president responds\u201d to natural disasters. The book is billed as \u201can excellent teaching tool\u201d that lets readers learn \u201cabout empathy by process of elimination.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhose Boat Is This Boat?\u201d isn\u2019t the first picture story to mock the Trump administration. \u201cLast Week Tonight with John Oliver Presents a Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo\u201d is a best-selling parody of \u201cMarlon Bundo\u2019s Day in the Life of a Vice President,\u201d a tribute to the family\u2019s pet bunny written by Mike Pence\u2019s daughter, Charlotte Pence, and illustrated by his wife, Karen Pence. The vice president is known for his conservative social views; in Oliver\u2019s book, Marlon Bundo has fallen for a fellow male bunny.\n\nCharlotte Pence herself bought a copy of the Oliver edition, noting that proceeds went to charity. Colbert senses he may have similar luck with Trump and his family.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing, from the voices inside my head, is that he enjoys it,\u201d Colbert said, mimicking the president\u2019s own fact-checking style. \u201cEverybody is saying he likes it.\u201d",

Jersey Shore star Ronnie Ortiz-Magro and Jen Harley called it quits in 2019, but the pair are still very much in each other\u2019s orbit as they coparent their daughter, Ariana.\n\nThe duo began dating in July 2017 \u2014 and their relationship was tumultuous from the very beginning. Shortly after they got together, Ortiz-Magro left their home in Las Vegas to shoot Jersey Shore: Family Vacation. As the show later revealed, the reality star\u2019s behavior during filming made his roommates question whether he was staying faithful to Harley.\n\nAfter one of the cheating-themed episodes aired in April 2018, the couple started exchanging insults via social media and seemingly got into a physical altercation on Instagram Live. They broke up and tried to focus on coparenting Ariana amicably.\n\nThe truce didn\u2019t last, though, and by May 2018 they were publicly feuding again after Ortiz-Magro appeared to cheat in another Family Vacation episode. They got back together briefly, then split again before the month was out. \u201cIt\u2019s going to keep changing every day,\u201d a source told Us Weekly at the time.\n\nIn June 2018, the on-off couple were involved in a public altercation while filming Family Vacation. Police determined that \u201ca battery did not take place,\u201d but two weeks later, Harley was arrested for yet another altercation with Ortiz-Magro. The Clark County District Attorney eventually decided not to press charges against Harley, saying there was \u201cinsufficient evidence.\u201d\n\nThe pair seemingly got back on track for the rest of the summer, but in October 2018, the MTV personality shared a photo of himself with a black eye and implied that his then-girlfriend was to blame. They exchanged more digs via social media but reunited in time to do a couple\u2019s costume for Halloween.\n\nTheir pattern of on-again, off-again dating continued through most of 2019 until things hit a breaking point that October, when Ortiz-Magro was arrested and charged with seven misdemeanors, including domestic violence. He pleaded not guilty to all charges the following month.\n\nThe exes kept things civil throughout 2020 and each moved on with new partners, but in April 2021, the New York native was arrested for a second time while in Los Angeles. Harley was not involved, though a source told Us that Ortiz-Magro had Ariana in his care at the time of his arrest.\n\nHow big are reality star salaries? Jason Tartick breaks it down with Us Weekly editors.\n\nAfter news of his arrest broke, Harley drove from Las Vegas to L.A. to retrieve Ariana and claimed that it was the \u201clast time\u201d she planned to make that drive. The former couple did not address the situation any further.\n\nKeep scrolling for a complete history of Ortiz-Magro and Harley\u2019s dramatic relationship.\n\nIf you or someone you know are experiencing domestic violence, please call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential support.",

        "content": "HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN I TONYA? It. Is. So. Good. I freaking love it. I was, like, 5 years old or something when the real Tonya Harding did her first triple axle, but watching Margot Robbie do a pretend triple axle for this incredible film was the next best thing. Her performance definitely gained the attention of The Academy, and Margot Robbie's reaction to her Oscars nomination for her role as Tonya Harding is the best thing I've seen all week.\n\nThe bio-pic plotline follows the infamous scandal between Olympic figure skaters Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan. Harding was a rough around the edges, self-proclaimed \"red neck\" who fought her way to the 1994 Olympics. Her biggest competitor was Nancy Kerrigan, who was renowned far and wide as \"America's sweetheart.\" During this time, Harding's ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and Harding's bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt hired a man to attack Kerrigan in hopes of breaking her leg so she would be unable to compete. Ultimately, they bruised Kerrigan badly, but she continued on to win the silver medal in the Olympics. Harding took eighth place, and was ultimately banned from the U.S. Figure Skating Association for life thanks to her involvement in the attack.\n\nThat's the gist, but my God, is Harding's personal life so much more complicated.\n\nRobbie totally stepped up to the plate (and then some) to play this intricate, complicated, weirdly funny, and profoundly impactful character. The Australian actress trained for months on the ice skating rink, and nailed Harding's blue-collar accent with incredible ease. Robbie's performance is a full-on triumph.\n\nHere's just a very small taste of Robbie's work in the I, Tonya trailer.\n\nYES, YES, YES.\n\nNow, she's riding her ice skates all the way to the Oscars. Robbie is nominated for Leading Actress in a Motion Picture, and she seems pretty freaking jazzed about it. Actually, it's her first Oscar nomination ever.\n\nRobbie's brother, Cameron, shared a video on social media showing his sister celebrating the good news. It's seriously so fun to watch.\n\nHe understandably captioned the video with excited gibberish. Later, he shared a photo hugging his sister with the caption,\n\nThere\u2019s nothing I could say that articulates how proud I am of this one #whatamoment#academyawardnomaninee!\n\nNot for nothing, Robbie is up against some pretty fierce competition. The other nominees in her category include Sally Hawkins from The Shape Of Water, Frances McDormand from Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri, Saoirse Ronan from Lady Bird, and Meryl Freaking Streep for her work in The Post.\n\nI do not envy The Academy on this one.\n\nFor Robbie, this nomination must be total validation for a job well done. She shared a little bit of her acting process with Rolling Stones and how she worked to embody Harding's \"spirit.\" She said,\n\nWe deal with a lot of class issues and the scrutiny from the media. I wanted it to feel like the world was bearing down on her ... I wanted her shoulders rounded, her head to be stooped. I wanted her to always be on the defense \u2013 and whenever she was sitting to be sitting forward, waiting for validation, like she was waiting for a skating score... I watched for about six months every single thing, every bit of skating, every bit of interview, every documentary, I played it [on] my iPod at night ... I had her face, like, painted on the inside of my eyelids and her voice just constantly in my head.\n\nVivien Killilea/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nTune in to see if Robbie takes home the gold (GET IT? Like, the Olympics, but also the Oscars?) on Sunday, Mar. 4, on ABC!\n\nCheck out the entire Gen Why series and other videos on Facebook and the Bustle app across Apple TV, Roku, and Amazon Fire TV.",

And though it only gives us a tiny glimpse of Roberts in character as caseworker Heidi Bergman (she literally just scribbles down some notes, says the above line to someone off camera and then clicks on a tape recorder) we\u2019re already entranced by her calm, collected mannerisms. Luckily, Amazon also revealed that you won\u2019t have to wait much longer, as \u201cHomecoming\u201d will premiere this November on the streaming service.\n\nThe rest of the one-minute clip promoting the mind-bending drama directed by \u201cMr. Robot\u201d creator Sam Esmail, explores the abandoned halls of what we can safely assume is the titular Homecoming Transitional Support Center where Heidi workers, a Geist Group facility helping soldiers transition back to civilian life.\n\nWalter Cruz (Stephan James) is one of these soldiers, eager to begin the next phase of his life. Overseeing Heidi and the facility is Colin Belfast (Bobby Cannavale), an ambitious company man whose manic demands point to questionable motives.\n\nFour years later, Heidi has started a new life, living with her mother (Sissy Spacek) and working as a small-town waitress, when a Department of Defense auditor (Shea Whigham) comes to her with questions about why she left the Homecoming facility. Heidi begins to realize that there\u2019s a whole other story behind the story she\u2019s been telling herself.\n\nBased on the popular podcast of the same name, \u201cHomecoming\u201d is created by Eli Horowitz and Micah Bloomberg. Along with Roberts, the cast includes Jeremy Allen White, Alex Karpovsky and Dermot Mulroney, among others.\n\nMulroney is set for a recurring guest star role as Anthony, Heidi\u2019s (Roberts) boyfriend, who is eager to please, but a bit needy and grows increasingly frustrated with Heidi\u2019s lack of attention to him and their relationship.\n\n\u201cHomecoming\u201d is produced by Esmail through his production company Esmail Corp; as well as \u201cMr. Robot\u201d executive producer Chad Hamilton of Anonymous Content; the podcast\u2019s Horowitz and Bloomberg; and Chris Giliberti, Alex Blumberg, and Matt Lieber of Gimlet Media.

        "content": "Since about 2015, America has become increasingly infatuated with complicated murder cover-ups. From HBO's The Jinx and the critically acclaimed Serial podcast to Netflix's Making a Murderer and the ongoing list of retellings of the OJ Simpson trial, we can't seem to get enough stories about the elaborate ins and outs of America's unjust justice system. Now, Netflix is banking on this trend with a new true crime docu-series titled The Keepers, which, according to Vanity Fair, will tell the mysterious story of Sister Cathy Cesnik's demise.\n\nThis isn't Netflix's first venture into true crime since the runaway success of Making a Murderer. The streaming service debuted the film Amanda Knox last year, which explored the fallout of an international criminal investigation on the eponymous subject's life. The movie received critical approval but didn't quite go viral in the way that speculation around the Avery family, the subjects of Making a Murderer, did following that series.\n\nSome seem to be banking on The Keepers as the next big thing when it comes to true crime. The upcoming seven-part series is described as an investigation into the \u201cunsolved murder of a nun and the horrific secrets and pain that linger nearly five decades after her death.\u201d Sister Cathy was killed in Baltimore in 1969, with her case to this day remaining unsolved. Many speculate her killing was part of a Byzantine conspiracy related to sexual abuse within the Catholic Church.\n\n\"The case returned to the spotlight in the 1990s when one of Sister Cathy\u2019s former students\u2014a woman only known as 'Jane Doe'\u2014came forward to share her experience of horrendous sexual abuse by the high school\u2019s chaplain,\" says Netflix's official description of the new show. \"Incredibly, 'Jane Doe' revealed she was also taken to Sister Cathy\u2019s undiscovered body and told, 'See what happens when you say bad things about people.' Despite this and testimony from other victims and witnesses of abuse, no one was held accountable, and the story was largely unreported outside of Baltimore... Through conversations with dozens of friends, relatives, journalists, government officials and Baltimore citizens determined to uncover the truth, [director Ryan White] pieces together a story that goes beyond the death of a beloved Catholic school teacher to encompass clergy abuse, repressed memories and government and religious institutions that he says 'at best, dropped the ball over the last 45 years\u2014and, at worst, covered it up.\"\n\nWhite is best known for his work on the marriage equality documentary The Cast Against 8 and the 2016 film Serena. The series is set to debut in full, as per Netflix tradition, on May 19.\n\nBy the way, Making the Murderer is slated for a season two, although details on that are few and far between. Cindy Holland, Netflix's VP of original content, said the following in January of this year: \u201cThe story is still ongoing, so you will see new episodes coming sometime this year as this story continues to unfold. We don\u2019t know when for sure new episodes will be coming.\u201d",

The marriage service will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, David Connor, with the Archbishop presiding as the couple make their vows.\n\nTuesday\u2019s service observed the full ritual of the Church with holy water from the River Jordan from the private Royal Family font poured on Miss Markle\u2019s head.\n\nThe Chapel Royal at St James\u2019s Palace is particularly significant in Harry\u2019s life as well as the history of the Royal Family.\n\nIt is where Princess Diana\u2019s body lay for a week before her funeral in 1997 and where King Charles I received the Holy Sacrament before his execution in 1649.\n\nThe chapel also hosted Prince George\u2019s christening in 2013.\n\nAmong those assisting with the service was the Crown Jeweller Mark Appleby, who brought the silverware used for Royal Family christenings. This included a silver font, basin and flask of holy oil.\n\nIn accordance with tradition Miss Markle had two sponsors, the equivalent of godparents, to support her in the baptism.\n\nIt is understood one supporter was a close girlfriend.\n\nMiss Markle was following partly in the footsteps of the Duchess of Cambridge, who was baptised as an infant but had a private confirmation after her engagement to Prince William.\n\nMiss Markle, 36 (right, with Prince Harry), had asked the 62-year-old Archbishop, Justin Welby (left), to lead the service after forming a close bond with him in recent weeks as he instructed her on the rites and sacraments of the Church\n\nThe Chapel Royal choir of six Gentlemen-in-Ordinary and ten Children of the Chapel \u2013 the oldest continuous musical organisation in the world \u2013 performed throughout the service.\n\nIt is not thought either Miss Markle\u2019s mother, Doria Ragland, or her father, Thomas Markle, who are divorced, travelled from the US for the service.\n\nHowever, it is understood there were 18 guests who after the ceremony walked to Clarence House, where Charles and Camilla hosted a dinner.\n\nMiss Markle\u2019s multi-faith upbringing is not uncommon in California where she was born in 1981.\n\nThe chapel also hosted Prince George\u2019s christening in 2013. The young royal is pictured arriving for his first day at school at Thomas's School in Battersea\n\nHer father, a retired Hollywood lighting director, was Episcopalian \u2013 the main US offshoot of the Anglican Church \u2013 while her mother belonged to another Protestant denomination.\n\nAfter her parents split, Miss Markle attended the Roman Catholic Immaculate Heart girls\u2019 high school in Los Angeles, although she was not Catholic.\n\nHer first husband Trevor Engelson was Jewish but she did not convert to his faith. The couple met in 2004 and married in 2011 but were divorced two years later.\n\nChurch guidelines suggest that Miss Markle may be interviewed about her divorce from Engelson, a film producer.\n\nIf such a conversation were to occur, the minister would ask if there had been \u2018sufficient healing of the personal and social wounds\u2019 from the divorce.\n\nThe Church of England conducted 111,500 baptisms last year, of which 9 per cent were for those aged over 13.\n\nGuidance from one church notes: \u2018If you are an adult and want to be baptised and/or confirmed, you must undertake a course of preparation called catechesis.\n\n'This takes place over several months in order to give you a thorough grounding in knowledge of the Christian faith.\u2019\n\nKensington Palace declined to comment.",

It\u2019s just, you know, Broadway\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked a lot about it and we kind of took a first round of meetings to explore that universe,\u201d McKenna added at Monday\u2019s Television Critics Association press tour. \u201cWe\u2019re busy figuring out this end of the TV chapter, but we are definitely intending to do a play.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just wanted the \u2018Likes\u2019 on Instagram,\u201d Bloom said. She got more than 11,000 for the effort, which our readers can see below.\n\n\u201cBathroom selfie with @abmck [McKenna] on this Galentines Day,\u201d Bloom\u2019s Instagram post read. \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating it by doing our first round of NYC meetings for the \u2018Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\u2019 Broadway musical. Coming to Broadway in probably 2150 because that\u2019s how Broadway works I think.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the post that accompanied that caption:\n\nEarlier during the TCA panel, Bloom and McKenna explained the odd-but-apparently-creative choice to recast Santino Fontana\u2019s role of Greg in favor of new star Skylar Astin.\n\n\u201cWhen Rachel and I were conceiving the show we had always sort of intended that Greg and Rebecca\u2019s romance would end sort of where it did,\u201d McKenna said.\n\nBut much like the show has continued to explore the character of Josh despite the end of his romance with Rebecca, McKenna and Bloom wanted to find new ways to incorporate Greg despite Fontana\u2019s departure at the beginning of Season 2.\n\n\u201cRachel and I had always been exploring bringing back that character and sort of trying to figure out a way to do it that suited our show,\u201d McKenna continued. \u201cSo now bringing the character of Greg back, he is part of our storytelling. It\u2019s a plot point in the story that the character is reimagined and so he\u2019s going to be played by a different actor, which is Skylar.\u201d",

And our arms are open. And our hearts two fold.

We think it's fair to say that Tay has done good, don't you?\n\nThe Independent\n\n\"One of Swift's greatest talents as a songwriter is to encapsulate those small moments, often in a new relationship, that you as a listener cannot.\n\n\"Each of the 15 songs on Reputation tackles how she is perceived by the people who know her and the people who don't. She acknowledges that even those closest to her will have differing ideas. A lover, a friend, a parent who has to see another Taylor Swift takedown online.\"\n\nRolling Stone\n\n\"From the sounds of her excellent sixth album, Swift spent that time going into deeper, darker, more introspective places. Reputation is her most intimate album \u2013 a song cycle about how it feels when you stop chasing romance and start letting your life happen.\n\n\"As one of the all-time great pop masterminds, she's trying something new, as she always does. But because she's Taylor Swift, she can't stop being her own turbulent, excessive, exhausting and gloriously extra self.\"\n\nThe Guardian\n\n\"At their best, these songs have a fizzing, pugilistic energy that recalls Britney Spears' brilliant, mid-breakdown, screw-you-all 2007 album Blackout (in another reference to Spears, the brilliant chorus of 'Don't Blame Me' features a chord progression that recalls '...Baby, One More Time').\n\n\"At their least appealing, they're still decent pop songs, but they feel generic: they could be by Rihanna or Rita Ora.\"\n\nThe New York Times\n\n\"The bombastic, unexpected, sneakily potent Reputation is many things: It's the first album on which Ms Swift has cursed (\"damn\" doesn't count); it's the first time she has sung about consuming alcohol (and repeatedly at that); and it's the vehicle for her most overt songs about sexual agency.\n\n\"But it is also Ms Swift chasing that good feeling, pushing back against a decade of following her own instincts. And it works.\"\n\nThe Telegraph\n\n\"Reputation is a big, brash, all-guns-blazing blast of weaponised pop that grapples with the vulnerability of the human heart as it is pummelled by 21st century fame... Reputation sees the savvy Swift turn crisis into opportunity. This is an album with blockbuster event status.\"\n\nWant up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?

A spokesman for the palace said that the royal family did not fund the event and it was held on the palace's public grounds.\n\nPrince Harry and Prince William, of course, live in Kensington Palace along with the Duchess of Cambridge and several other royal figures. Interestingly, reports emerged that the princes in fact did not attend the party, despite their involvement in the film and their presence at the premiere. That means that Kate Middleton and Meghan Markel were also absent from the festivities.\n\nThose who did party hard on palace grounds included \"Star Wars\" lead actors Daisy Ridley, John Boyegea and Laura Dern, as well as UK native Andrew Garfield -- who isn't in the cast, but who would turn down such an invitation?\n\n\"At Kensington Gardens for our after party,\" Dern wrote on Instagram. \"With my gorgeous friend and mentor, Andrew.\"\n\nIt's unclear if the real-life Luke Skywalker, Mark Hamill, attended the party -- he was active on Twitter late Tuesday night, although it's possible he was just popping onto his phone every once in awhile while enjoying the evening.\n\nEarlier in the night, Prince William and Harry were beyond enchanted to meet beloved droid BB-8.

One of Pink's funnier confessions was proudly admitting to snooping on husband Carey Hart's phone.\n\n\"The code changes a lot,\" she cracked. \"I always figure it out though.\"\n\nDuring their separate interviews, Pink talked about her emotional speech while accepting the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at this year's MTV Video Music Awards. Though her speech was for her adorable 6-year-old daughter, Willow, and centered on not conforming to one standard of beauty, she admitted Willow was \"incredibly unimpressed\" with her!\n\n\"I was like, 'Babe are you excited about today? I\u2019m going to win an award and I\u2019m going to do a show,'\" she recalled. \"And she goes, 'Exactly how many minutes after you sing does my sleepover start?' I was like, 'Dude, can you pretend to be excited for me?'\"\n\nOn a more serious note, Pink reiterated that she'll never conform to try and look like anyone else.\n\n\"I will not,\" she said. \"And I get my feelings hurt. I get my feelings hurt all the time -- it hurts. It doesn't feel good to hear mean things about yourself, but if you\u2019re human, you\u2019re going to hear it.

A spokesperson for the family said West died of leukemia, surrounded by family.\n\nA cultural phenomenon from the moment it debuted on January 12, 1966 on ABC, Batman was a twice-weekly treat for children \u2013 with its comic book-style POW!s and BAM!s highlighting the climactic fight scenes \u2013 and, with its campy humor and pop-art visuals, adults as well.\n\nRex Features via AP\n\nA parade of weekly villains \u2013 from Cesar Romero\u2019s Joker, Frank Gorshin\u2019s Riddler, Burgess Meredith\u2019s Penguin and, impeccably, Julie Newmar\u2019s Catwoman \u2013 passed through 120 episodes from beginning to the March 14, 1968 end, but it was West and Burt Ward as his sidekick (and ward) Robin that anchored the happenings with a note-perfect send-up of stoicism.\n\n\u201cOur dad always saw himself as The Bright Knight,\u201d West\u2019s family said in a statement, \u201cand aspired to make a positive impact on his fans\u2019 lives. He was and always will be our hero.\u201d\n\nWest is survived by his wife Marcelle, six children, five grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren. His career spanned six decades during which he appeared in more than 50 films and television shows, most recently as the voice of Mayor Adam West on Family Guy, and as a guest star on The Big Bang Theory.\n\nWest, a Seattle native born William West Anderson on September 19, 1928, began working in local radio while still in college, served as an announcer on American Forces Network television during an Army stint, then worked at various local TV stations, at one point landing a gig in Hawaii co-hosting a weekday show with Peaches the chimp.\n\nA Warner Brothers contract brought a steady stream of bit roles, guest shots and series regular spots on episodic television as the \u201950s eased into the \u201960s: Lawman, Sugarfoot, Cheyenne, Bronco, Colt .45, 77 Sunset Strip, Hawaiian Eye, The Detectives, Bonanza, Petticoat Junction, Bewitched, and films like Tammy and the Doctor and, with the Three Stooges, The Outlaws Is Coming.\n\nOddly enough, it was West\u2019s appearance in a spy-themed Nestle\u2019s Quik commercial that got noticed by producer William Dozier, and West was soon cast, along with newcomer Ward, in the arch series about arch-villains and the Caped Crusaders who, week after week, tracked them, fought them and finally handed them over to Commissioner Gordon (Neil Hamilton) and Police Chief O\u2019Hara (Stafford Repp).\n\nThough the series quickly attained an odd combo of mass popularity and cult fervor, the joke \u2013 and the budget \u2013 began wearing thin just as fast, and a third season crept along without as much assistance from Yvonne Craig\u2019s new Batgirl as might have been necessary.\n\nAssociated Press\n\nWest, like Ward and others who populated the California-sunny Gotham City, would never overcome the typecasting, and by 1980 was eking out a career in embarrassments like The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood. After semi-retirement in Idaho, he\u2019d eventually embrace his past by voicing animated programs from 1984\u2019s Superfriends: The Legendary Super Powers Show to 2004\u2019s The Batman (not, alas, in the title role). He became familiar to 21st Century generations via Family Guy (as Mayor Adam West), Comic-Con and other nostalgia appearances and the 2014 release of Batman on DVD.\n\nWest received a star on The Hollywood Hall of Fame star in 2012, a moment captured in James E.

        "content": "Despite ample screen time and her abundant charisma, Gal Gadot, the most significant Israeli find since the Dead Sea Scrolls, is unable to rescue this meandering, dreary and pointless movie.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just dull, it\u2019s infuriating. The whole world loves these characters, and so much time, effort and money has been hurled at this property. But the story in \u201cJustice League\u201d is practically nonexistent \u2014 and, even more insulting, the big Hollywood special effects look like garbage.\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nIf this were a low-budget matinee B-picture, I\u2019d let it slide. But this tentpole franchise picture, which opens November 16, cost more than the GDP of some small nations. What a mess.\n\nThings kick off when Batman, aka Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck), is fighting crime in Gotham (as he does) but starts noticing more and more fly-creatures. (Parademons, they are called, if you pay close attention.) As they implode they leave behind a mark: three squares. It\u2019s something Batman remembers scribbled in Lex Luthor\u2019s notebooks, so clearly they are evil.\n\nHe decides it\u2019s time to call upon the other \u201cmetahumans\u201d that were briefly glimpsed in \u201cBatman V Superman: Dawn of Justice.\u201d\n\nFirst there\u2019s Aquaman (Jason Momoa) who is entertaining, but isn\u2019t given much to do but swim. There\u2019s also Cyborg (Ray Fisher), a gloomy kid in a hoodie, who spends most of his time staring at his hands. There\u2019s also Superman (Henry Cavil) but he\u2019s dead for the first half (unlike the drama in this story, which is dead throughout). Then there\u2019s Barry Allen, aka The Flash (Ezra Miller), but more on him later.\n\nBefore collecting the team we cut to some Wonder Woman action, in which she foils a terrorist attack at the British Museum. It\u2019s not shot as well as the action in Gal Gadot\u2019s solo film, \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d but once again she is impressive in her athletic moves, half-smiles and reaction shots.\n\nGal Gadot may not be much of a thespian (her voice-over exposition about those three mysterious cubes later in the film sounds as if she\u2019s as confused as we are) but she\u2019s a remarkable movie star.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just that she \u201clooks good\u201d \u2014 her glances exude the confidence and grace that would have made her a legend even back in the days of silent film. She and the camera love one another. Yes, it may be ridiculous that she, in her position as an art conservator at the Louvre, dusts statues in a tight, laced-up white dress and push-up bra, but no one ever came to superhero movies for their realism.\n\nIt\u2019s lucky she doesn\u2019t need any dazzling effects to brighten the frame, because the computer imagery in \u201cJustice League\u201d is just awful. There\u2019s a green screened cornfield that had my audience laughing. The action in this movie is so video game-like I almost grabbed a controller based solely on muscle memory.\n\nThe fighting comes when the big villain, a poorly rendered Minotaur-ish ghoul called Steppenwolf, emerges from a portal to collect those three boxes I keep talking about. When he has accomplished this the \u201cUnity\u201d will be complete, and then, I dunno, I guess he\u2019ll get lower interest rates or something. His plans are very vague.\n\nWhat isn\u2019t vague is just how much Batman feels sorry for the fact that Superman got injured in the last installment. This, in addition to wanting to save the world, is what motivates him to create this new superhero team-up.\n\nAquaman, like I mentioned, is something of a breath of fresh air (ironic, as he breathes underwater) as he is played like a lovable tough guy \u2014 the type of dude who will smash beer cans on his head. Opposite him in the testosterone department is Barry Allen, and I guess it\u2019s time for the big reveal: The Flash is Jewish.\n\nNo, I don\u2019t just mean that Ezra Miller, the actor, is Jewish. I mean the character, for the first time in its 77-year-old history, is a member of the Hebraic faith. Baruch Hashem!\n\nThe Barry Allen we see here is a motormouth kid who describes himself as an \u201cattractive Jewish boy\u201d who plays the viola, is into web design, sign language and, also, gorilla sign language. He has trouble making friends because he\u2019s always a mile ahead of everyone else. (He gets a little schtick about not understanding brunch.)\n\nHe also eats nonstop, thanks to his high metabolism, which he describes as being in a \u201csnack hole\u201d thanks to his molecules living in the Speed Force. (In case you don\u2019t know, The Flash\u2019s main deal is he can run really fast. But can he run as fast as Superman?)\n\nWhile it\u2019s great to see Jewish representation in a mainstream international film, it\u2019s undeniable that the character is meant as borderline annoying comic relief. On the one hand he\u2019s cute; on the other hand it is cringeworthy when he tries to go in for a fist-bump with the cool African-American kid (Cyborg) who looks at him like he\u2019s a big dork.\n\nThe best thing you can say about \u201cJustice League\u201d is that it is a relatively quick two hours. \u201cBatman V Superman\u201d lasted roughly 40 days and 40 nights. It\u2019ll still be a big hit, and you may even find yourself dragged to the theater with excited kids, but don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\n\nLuckily, when a team is involved no one gets the full blame. Ezra Miller will still get a solo Flash picture and maybe that\u2019ll still be good. (The Flash that\u2019s currently on TV is, however, much better.)\n\nAn aside: With the same creative team in place for Wonder Woman\u2019s sequel there\u2019s every reason to think it\u2019ll be comparable to the first one. Heck, maybe Wonder Woman and Flash can even team up some day. What if the Justice League was \u201cjust us,\u201d huh?",

McCullough Sr.[1][2] Her mother was a member of the United States Navy for 23 years, and McCullough thus lived in various places such as Sicily, South Korea, Japan, and Hawaii.[3] She was later raised and completed high school in Virginia Beach, Virginia.[4] McCullough attended the HBCU South Carolina State University, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry with a concentration in radiochemistry and served as the school's 75th Miss South Carolina State University.[5][1][6] While a student, she was a member of the American Chemical Society, the Health Physics Society, and the American Nuclear Society.[7] She has been inducted into the Golden Key International Honour Society and the National Society of Black Engineers.[7][1]\n\nPrior to becoming Miss USA, McCullough worked as an emergency preparedness specialist in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response.[8][9]\n\nPageantry [ edit ]\n\nPrior to winning Miss District of Columbia USA 2017, she was the first runner-up for Miss District of Columbia USA twice, in 2015 and 2016, respectively, to Lizzy Olsen and Deshauna Barber. In 2017, she was crowned Miss District of Columbia USA 2017 by Miss USA 2016 Barber. On May 14, 2017, McCullough competed in the Miss USA 2017 pageant in Las Vegas. She went on to win the competition, beating out first runner-up Chhavi Verg of New Jersey and second runner-up Meridith Gould of Minnesota.[10] During her time at Miss USA, McCullough received media attention and praise for deciding to compete with her natural hair, which was seen as support for the natural hair movement.[11][12][13] McCullough was both criticized and praised[14] for her conservative question answers, stating that health care was a privilege for the working and not a right, in addition to calling herself an \"equalist\" as opposed to a feminist.[4] She is the seventh Miss USA titleholder born outside the United States.[8]\n\nAs Miss USA, McCullough earned the right to represent the United States at Miss Universe 2017 on November 26, 2017. Like Miss USA 2017, the competition was held in Las Vegas. McCullough advanced to the top ten of the competition before being eliminated. The winner of the competition was ultimately Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters of South Africa.[15][16][17]\n\nOn May 21, 2018, McCullough crowned Sarah Rose Summers as her successor at the Miss USA 2018 competition, held in Shreveport, Louisiana.[18][19][20][21]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nIn 2020, McCullough married professional basketball player Garrett Temple, in a private ceremony because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[22][23][24] They have one child.[25][26] Temple's father-in-law is Collis Temple,[27] a former professional basketball player.",

Many celebrities have deleted all of their Instagram photos over the years for different reasons, including promoting new projects or starting fresh after a breakup. Blake Lively is the latest star to pull the stunt, although Taylor Swift made headlines last year for entirely removing her social media presence. Thank You! You [\u2026]\n\nThe couple, identified by USA Today as Anthony Yannuzzi and Stephanie Pysher, say they met at a Taylor Swift concert five years ago, when the singer was touring in support of her album Red. Now Swift is on her Reputation stadium tour, and Yannuzzi has been covertly plotting his proposal since June with the Twitter handle @TSphilaPROPOSAL. \u201cI NEED YOUR HELP!\u201d he tweeted on June 3. \u201cI want to give my girlfriend the proposal of her dreams!

Take a look at some of the star's celebrity best friends -- including Demi Lovato, Ed Sheeran, Lily Aldridge, and more\n\nFortuitously, Yannuzzi and Pysher were randomly selected to take a photo with Swift during a meet-and-greet backstage. Yannuzzi got down on bended knee, Pysher said yes, and Swift watched the proposal with mouth agape. The singer later shared a photo of the happy occasion on Instagram, captioning the pic with the hashtag \u201c#thirdwheel.\u201d\n\nSwift\u2019s concert in Philadelphia the following night made headlines, too, since a stage malfunction trapped her in a \u201csparkly basket\u201d in midair.\n\nRelated: Most Influential Celebrities on Social Media Social media has allowed celebrities to directly communicate with fans over the years. Platforms like Twitter and Instagram have given users a closer look at their favorite celebrities, granting them direct access into their world.

So what happens now is basically I\u2019m just chilling waiting to figure out what happens next.\u201d\n\nSwift then joined the audience in an a cappella version of her 2007 track \u201cOur Song\u201d before getting into another floating basket and resuming the show.",

Subsequently, dozens of accusers have come forward to allege that Weinstein harassed them, and a handful have accused Weinstein of sexual assault.\n\nThe board has faced uncomfortable questions about how much it knew, with top company figures like Bob Weinstein and president David Glasser saying they knew that Harvey Weinstein could be angry and abusive, and knew that he cheated on his wife, but did not know of his alleged sexual abuses.\n\nLast week, Amazon pulled the plug on a Weinstein Co. project under development from David O. Russell, and took over production of TWC\u2019s \u201cThe Romanoffs.\u201d\n\nThe board fired Weinstein on Oct. 8, citing a violation of the company\u2019s code of ethics. Weinstein\u2019s attorney, Patricia Glaser, has argued that his termination was improper, as the board was aware of several settlements when Weinstein signed his most recent contract in 2015.\n\nBoard member Tarak Ben Ammar announced on Monday that the company was exploring a possible sale to Colony Capital, the private equity firm run by Tom Barrack. Colony Capital provided a cash infusion in an effort to stabilize the company.\n\nLance Maerov, an executive at WPP, is the third remaining board member. As the scandal worsened, five board members resigned. They include Tim Sarnoff, Paul Tudor Jones, Dirk Ziff, Marc Lasry and Richard Koenigsberg.",

If you watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians or read Kourtney\u2019s blog, you might have noticed just how passionate the reality star is about natural beauty.\n\nAhead, we take a look at some of Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s beauty secrets for natural skin care, including what natural deodorant she uses and how she keeps her skin hydrated with manuka honey.\n\nCoconut oil\n\nSuperfood ingredients such as coconut oil have made their mark on natural skin care and beauty products. And, like many natural beauty devotees, Kourtney is no stranger to its beauty benefits. On top of using the natural oil in her hair, the reality star likes to moisturize her body with it, too. According to her app, Kourtney applies coconut oil to her body skin \u201cright out of the shower\u201d and let it sit for 10 minutes.\n\nIn addition, the reality star uses coconut oil in some homemade beauty recipes, too. One of Kourtney\u2019s go-to\u2019s? A DIY lip scrub made with coconut oil, manuka honey, and sugar. The natural concoction gently sloughs off dry skin and nourishes for a silky soft, smooth, lipstick-ready pout.\n\nManuka honey\n\nAnother all-natural ingredient Kourtney Kardashian swears by for skin care? Manuka honey. The reality star is a big fan of Manuka Doctor skin care products and also swears by the all-natural superfood honey for home skin treatments.\n\nThanks to its natural humectants and anti-aging properties, manuka honey can be used in beauty for many things. For soft, hydrated skin, more youthful-looking skin, apply manuka honey to the complexion as a face mask and let it sit for about 10 minutes before rinsing. You can also add it to homemade beauty product or as a spot treatment on pimples. In addition to being anti-aging and hydrating, manuka honey also boasts anti-bacterial properties that can help combat breakouts and keep the complexion clear.\n\ngood morning A post shared by Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Oct 7, 2017 at 10:57am PDT\n\nNatural deodorant\n\nLike other celebrities and wellness aficionados, Kourtney no longer uses chemical-ridden deodorants and switched to a natural deodorant. \u201cChanging over to an all-natural deodorant seemed like an important thing to do when I heard that when people are diagnosed with breast cancer, they are told to immediately discontinue using conventional antiperspirants and deodorants,\u201d the reality star shared in a blog post. \u201cAlthough research connecting the parabens and aluminum from these products directly with breast cancer is inconclusive, I like to play it safe,\u201d she concluded.\n\nSo, what natural deodorant does Kourtney swear by? Schmidt\u2019s Natural Ylang Ylang + Calendula deodorant. At $8.99 a pop, the natural deodorant is more affordable than other other natural brands. In addition, it features an award-winning formula made with essential oils and free of aluminum, parabens, propylene glycol, and phthalates.\n\nNatural sunscreen\n\nDeodorant isn\u2019t the only natural skin product Kourtney likes to use. As a California native, the reality star knows how crucial it is to protect her skin from the sun. That said, like many of her products, she prefers a more natural formula. Her favorite natural sunscreen? Drunk Elephant Umbra Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!",

Most of us don\u2019t get to experience what seasonal produce some chef named Serge is offering at a Michelin-starred restaurant, but darn it if I can\u2019t go to Hardee\u2019s and eat a burger with some weird boneless ribs on it that were marketed on Shark Tank (yes, this is a thing).\n\nThese limited-time offers are where fast food gets weird, and when fast food gets weird, it gets fun. There are a couple of basic rules for running a good promotion.\n\nDid you cram more crap on your food? Why didn\u2019t you cram more crap on your food?\n\nThat\u2019s it. It\u2019s simple. What McDonald\u2019s has done with this whole \u201cfrork\u201d fiasco is asked me to change my eating habits. It makes no damn sense. This is the veil being pulled off corporate America. Some dude in a $5,000 suit named \u201cTodd,\u201d probably with a \u201cJr.\u201d or \u201cIII\u201d on the end of his name, was looking for brownie points by saying: \u201cYou know, I think America wants an edible fork.\u201d\n\nNO I DON\u2019T WANT A DAMN EDIBLE FORK, TODD. I WANT TO CRAM THE FOOD INTO MY MOUTH CHUTE WITH MY UNWASHED HANDS BEFORE BLOWING MY NOSE ON THE GREASE-COVERED BAG AND SHAMEFULLY REALIZING I FINISHED AN ENTIRE MEAL AT A STOP LIGHT AND THEN SEEING THAT THE PERSON IN THE CAR NEXT TO ME VIDEO\u2019D ALL THIS. THAT\u2019S WHAT I WANT, TODD.\n\nThe frork appeals to a very limited part of the fast food Venn diagram, all of whom are idiots. It\u2019s people who want to keep their hands clean while eating, but also who want to get grease all over their fingers while they cram greasy fries into a fork-shaped holder.\n\nGOD, TODD, I SWEAR I HATE YOU SO MUCH.\n\nThey even released an infomercial about these things.\n\nLook, I know what you\u2019re thinking: This is all a tongue-in-cheek joke. I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s a joke. Time and effort were wasted on the frork that could have been used working out how to give me portable poutine at fast-food prices.\n\n\u201cA limited supply of Frorks will be available with the purchase of a Signature Crafted Recipes sandwich on May 5 at participating restaurants. These sandwiches sell for between $4.99 and $5.19.\u201d\n\nGosh wow. I really couldn\u2019t have worked out this was going to be a limited supply. You mean to tell me that this trash idea created by an idiot named Todd (probably) is only going to be a small test? Wow \u2014 couldn\u2019t have worked that one out.\n\nAnd you know the part that really annoys me. There\u2019s going to be someone out there who calls themselves a \u201cfast food historian\u201d who\u2019s going to line up on May 5 and try to get a frork.\n\nI have such a high tolerance for bad promotions, but goodness if this doesn\u2019t make me mad. I\u2019m just going to try to forget this happened, ignore the frork ads, and wistfully lose myself in the Pizza Hut \u201cPriazzo\u201d ad when they tried to make deep dish pizza in the \u201980s.\n\nP.S. Still hate you, Todd.",

She first filed her case in Maryland and took issue with an Aug. 19 article titled, \u201cNaked photoshoots, and troubling questions about visas that won\u2019t go away: The VERY racy past of Donald Trump\u2019s Slovenian wife.\u201d\n\nRepresented by Charles Harder, the same attorney who represented Hulk Hogan\u2019s privacy suit against Gawker Media, the lawsuit targeted a story that discussed \u201chighly-charged, lesbian-themed, nude photographs\u201d and also questioned the exact timing of when she traveled to the U.S. on a visa. Much of the article relied on the work of a Slovenian journalist who had co-authored an unauthorized biography of Ms. Trump. There was some reliance on a Slovenian magazine to make the claim that the modeling agency she worked at was run by a New York entrepreneur, who allegedly also operated an escort agency for wealthy clients. The story also suggested that she and Donald Trump met three years earlier than they acknowledged and \u201cstaged\u201d their actual meeting as a \u201cruse.\u201d\n\nMs. Trump also sued a Maryland blogger named Webster Griffin Tarpley, who made similar claims on his website.\n\nThe litigation triggered an interesting showdown over jurisdiction with a Maryland judge ultimately agreeing this case wasn\u2019t for her courtroom.\n\nThe case was then refiled, without Tarpley, in New York, and the case made more news with new pleadings that talked about lost business opportunities for Ms. Trump at a time when her husband was attempting to very lightly distance himself from a business empire for ethical reasons.\n\nBut the case won\u2019t last long.\n\nThe Daily Mail has now agreed to a retraction.\n\n\u201cWe accept that these allegations about Mrs Trump are not true and we retract and withdraw them,\u201d the publication\u2019s parent company said in the statement. \u201cWe apologise to Mrs Trump for any distress that our publication caused her.

Perhaps two. Really.\n\nThe designer in question is Giles Deacon, creator of Ms. Middleton\u2019s lace-covered gown, a dress that was, like that of her sister, firmly in the Grace Kelly-marrying-Prince-Rainier continuum: high-necked, cap-sleeved, molded to her torso; fairy tale and contemporary at the same time, with a full skirt but not a stuffed one. Not radical by any means.\n\nWhich is what was interesting.\n\nMr. Deacon, after all, made his name as part of the cooler, conceptual strain of British design. \u201cEccentric\u201d is an adjective often attached to his name. He\u2019s the guy who put Cate Blanchett in an enormous strapless empire gown at Cannes in 2015, decorated with a digitized print he called a \u201cTudor collage,\u201d and who dressed Solange Knowles in what looked like two oversize, unfurled fans for the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute Gala that same year. Last year, he stepped off the London Fashion Week schedule to show couture instead; a signal, seemingly, that he was going to go even more extreme and extravagant.\n\nSo when rumors began to fly that Ms. Middleton had picked Mr. Deacon to make her dress, it seemed unlikely. There was speculation that he had done her party frock for the reception (an outfit that remains a mystery, as the social media ban for the party seems to have succeeded, an extraordinary achievement these days), but that a more establishment choice \u2014 Catherine Walker, who ultimately dressed Carole Middleton, the mother of the bride, or Jenny Packham, a favorite of the Duchess of Cambridge \u2014 would do the bride\u2019s wedding dress.",

The KUWTK star is allegedly pregnant after publicly being seen with \u201cwhat appeared to be a bump\u201d in L.A. on July 30, a new report by OK! magazine claims! \u201cIt was strange to see because she\u2019s usually so perfectly svelte,\u201d a source told the outlet, and a friend to Kourt added, \u201cEveryone is whispering that she\u2019s pregnant with her fourth child.\u201d If Kourtney is supposedly pregnant, then who on Earth is the father to baby number four? And by that, we mean, is it once again baby daddy Scott Disick, 35, or ex-boyfriend Younes Bendjima, 25? Naturally, one would assume it\u2019s the younger model, who to the world was Kourtney\u2019s boyfriend up until recently. But Kourtney\u2019s anonymous friend makes a shocking claim \u2014 it\u2019s more than likely Scott!\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been meeting up on the down-low for a while now,\u201d the friend said, going so far as to add that Kourtney and Scott hooked up in Mexico. Keep in mind, Scott has been dating model Sofia Richie, 19, since 2017 \u2013 but reportedly, that was not on Scott\u2019s mind when he allegedly hooked up with Kourtney in a \u201crecent\u201d trip to Mexico, the magazine claims! \u201cThey made it look like a family trip because their kids [Mason, 8, Penelope, 6, and Reign, 3] were there, but they hooked up,\u201d the source said before adding, \u201cEveryone is buzzing that she\u2019s carrying Scott\u2019s baby.\u201d As far as we know, Kourtney and Scott, who broke up in 2015, haven\u2019t publicly taken a family vacay with the kids in Mexico since 2016. But they did go to Punta Mita, Mexico just days apart with their respective lovers in January. Scott then returned to Mexico for a Cabo San Lucas getaway with the kids, but it was Sofia who played mommy. Is the magazine insinuating that Kourtney was a secret stow-away? The friend went on to say that Kourtney wouldn\u2019t fret over Scott being her baby daddy again because \u201call of their kids came out beautifully.\u201d\n\nAnd apparently, Kourtney and Younes weren\u2019t together for as long as most assumed. News just broke on Aug. 8 that Kourtney actually ended her relationship with the 25-year-old model on the second week of July because he cheated on her. Still, if Kourtney\u2019s alleged baby bump wasn\u2019t just a mistaken case of bloating, then Younes could very well be the father. It takes between 12 to 16 weeks for a bump to show. Sixteen weeks ago, Kourt and Younes were still very much on! Despite all the speculations, everyone\u2019s stumped. Even Kourtney supposedly \u201cisn\u2019t sure how to handle this situation.\u201d The friend added that Kourtney \u201cisn\u2019t saying if the daddy is Scott, Younes or another mystery man she\u2019s been spending time with\u2026it may end up taking some of Kris [Jenner\u2019s] management skills to straighten out this mess!\u201d\n\nMaybe this report isn\u2019t so wild, after a source close to Sofia EXCLUSIVELY shared with HollywoodLife.com on Aug. 7 that Sofia gave her boyfriend an ultimatum \u2013 it\u2019s her or Kourtney! Is Sofia feeling threatened, which would only make the hookup rumors between Scott and Kourtney appear to be more than gossip? \u201c[Sofia] wants to live a life with Scott, have a future with Scott and have kids with Scott,\u201d our source told us. \u201cSo if he is thinking of getting back with Kourtney she wants none of it.\u201d\n\nHollywoodLife.com has reached out to Younes Bendjima\u2019s and Scott Disick\u2019s reps for a comment.",

He wondered, in vain, if they could drop him in by chopper this time, \u201cwhich is so clueless of me, because there\u2019s no landing pad, and it would mar the beauty of it all,\u201d he said. Hamill is a youthful 65 but a sexagenarian nevertheless; whereas the fit young members of the crew were given 45 minutes to get up to the now iconic Rey-Luke meeting spot\u2014carrying heavy equipment\u2014Hamill was allotted an hour and a half, \u201cand I had to stop every 10, 15 minutes to rest.\u201d\n\nNone of this was offered up in the form of complaint. Hamill just happens to be a rambling, expansive talker\u2014in his own way, as endearingly offbeat a character as his friend and on-screen twin sister, Carrie Fisher, who passed away suddenly and tragically last December. Like Fisher, Hamill was put on a diet-and-exercise regimen after he was reconscripted into the Star Wars franchise. (Harrison Ford was under less obligation, having retained his leading-man shape because he never stopped being a leading man.) Over a spartan snack plate of carrot sticks and hummus, the man behind Luke held forth at length on this subject.\n\nWatch the video below for a behind-the-scenes look at Annie Leibovitz\u2019s photo shoot with The Last Jedi cast and crew.\n\n\u201cYou just cut out all the things you love,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething as basic as bread and butter, which I used to start every meal with. Sugar. No more candy bars. No more stops at In-N-Out. It\u2019s really just a general awareness, because in the old days I\u2019d go, \u2018Well, I\u2019m not that hungry, but oh, here\u2019s a box of Wheat Thins,\u2019 and you don\u2019t put the Wheat Thins in the same category as Lay\u2019s potato chips, and yet I would sort of idly, absentmindedly eat these things while watching Turner Classic Movies, and \u2018Oh, I ate the whole box!\u2019 \u201d\n\nHamill had been dieting and training for 50 weeks before he learned, via the Episode VII script he finally received from Abrams, that he would not appear in the movie until its last scene, and in a nonspeaking part at that. On this, too, he has a lot of thoughts. Though he grants that the delayed-gratification reveal of Luke was a narrative masterstroke, he\u2019d have done things differently if he\u2019d had his druthers. Han Solo\u2019s death scene, for example. Why couldn\u2019t Luke have made his first appearance around then? In the finished film, the witnesses to Han\u2019s death, at the hands of his own son, the brooding dark-side convert Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), are his longtime Wookiee co-pilot, Chewbacca, and the upstart Resistance fighters Rey and Finn (John Boyega).",

Twitter burbled with happy Andy Samberg GIFs.\n\nBut for fans of \"Timeless,\" NBC's time-traveling drama that just wrapped up its second season on a gigantic cliffhanger, the network may be more goat than great. NBC has yet to decide if \"Timeless\" is canceled or renewed, which is unusual at this point in the season. Most shows learn their fate at their network's upfront presentation.\n\nYet NBC declined to make a decision on \"Timeless,\" saying it was still weighing its options.\n\nThat may sound like reason for fans to celebrate \u2014 if the show wasn't canceled, then that surely means the network sees some value in keeping it around, right? A big uptick in DVR viewership for the finale or a successful #RenewTimeless campaign (yes, it's been trending all week) might sway NBC just like it saved \"Brooklyn,\" no? Perhaps not.\n\nUltimately, \"Timeless's\" fate may be sealed by something playing a bigger and bigger role in the network TV business these days: the show's producer.\n\n\"Brooklyn\" is produced by Universal Television, the sister studio to NBC. That means the network had a vested interest in seeing \"Brooklyn\" make it to another season. A sixth season equals more syndication money, more VOD money and a bigger library of content to monetize across platforms in the future.\n\n\"Timeless,\" on the other hand, is produced by Sony Pictures Television.

Magazine:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the healthiest I\u2019ve been all my life.\n\nMy diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape. I have no sugar. I don\u2019t eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar.\n\nI eat chicken and salmon and rice. I eat avocados. I\u2019ll have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch. I try to do just 1,200 calories a day. It may sound like it\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s actually a lot of food if you eat the right things.\u201d\n\nSome of those concepts are NOT OK with me.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the positives. She has clearly realized that a daily intake of Cheetos and Frappuccinos won\u2019t do much to help her get back in shape.\n\nAdditionally, avocados and salmon are a great way to get healthy fats.\n\nNow, onto the \u201cnot so great\u201d attributes.\n\nI\u2019d like to think Britney is pointing out just a few of the foods she eats, rather than her daily staples. Otherwise, she is on the fast track to boredom with such a small selection.\n\nAnd, hello, where\u2019s the fiber?\n\nMy main frustration, however, stems from her claim that, in order to keep a sugar-free diet, Britney has cut out fruits and fruit juice.\n\nFruit juice, I can understand. After all, most fruit juices are simply sugar (in this case, fructose) water with vitamins. Since they are in liquid form, they don\u2019t do much in terms of satiety, either.\n\nBut giving up fruit? I can\u2019t think of any reason to do that.\n\nThink about it for a minute. Doesn\u2019t it sound slightly ridiculous to say, \u201cI\u2019m eating healthy, so no more fruit in MY fridge!\u201d?\n\nA medium sized apple only contains 90 calories, but also provides fiber, phytonutrients, and a variety of vitamins.\n\nPlease don\u2019t mistake that recent study about fructose intake and weight gain to mean you should never have fruit.\n\nThe fiber in whole fruit offsets the sharp rise in blood glucose you get when you drink pure fruit juice juice.\n\nBesides, a whole orange provides significantly lower levels of fructose than a glass of OJ.\n\nSo, Britney, please don\u2019t fear. A banana in the morning or some kiwi in the afternoon will not lead you astray.\n\nThank you to reader Kristin MacBride for sending along Britney\u2019s quote.",

Sonia Granados, 34, was surprised to learn her ex-husband Nick Pendergrast, 33, is expecting twins with his new girlfriend just three months after their divorce was finalized\n\nInstant family of four: Nick and his new love Heather Yerrid, 32, revealed on Thursday that she is nine-weeks pregnant with twins\n\nIn addition to being a love and relationship coach, Heather, 32, also covers Married at First Sight as a co-host on AfterBuzz TV, an online broadcast network that recaps episodes of a variety of television shows.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Sonia hinted that Heather's coverage of the reality program was biased - at least when it came to her.\n\n'Now we ALL know why after buzz was always throwing shade at me #Congrats2theLoveBirds,' Sonia tweeted.\n\nNick and Sonia separated in January and their divorce was finalized in April.

Heather, 32, is a co-host on AfterBuzz TV, an online broadcast network that recaps episodes of a variety of television shows - including Married at First Sight\n\nHe said, she said: Many Married at First Sight fans insisted their relationship timeline just didn't add up, and Sonia said he was with Heather while trying to 'work' things out with her\n\nAiring her grievances: Sonia added that she had a right to be 'irate' for many reasons\n\nOn May 3, he shared an Instagram photo of himself at the Museum of Broken Relationships in Los Angeles, presumable referencing his divorce, when he wrote: 'Had to leave my mark...'\n\nNick, who lived in Miami, Florida, at the time, told the outlet that he made the decision to move to California to be with Heather because he couldn't stop thinking about her.\n\nHe even asked his new love to join him on his cross-country trip over Memorial Day weekend.\n\n'On the five-day journey, we fell in love,' he said.

While he was trying to \"work\" things out with me but telling her different. Good luck to them both.'\n\nShe continued to share plenty of tweets from those who were Team Sonia, and she later returned to social media to state her case.\n\n'Wish Heather n Nick well but I have a right to b irate 4 many things n tweet what I want!

'Correction: irate at her misleading me and at him not being able to ever be a MAN about anything!'\n\nThe news caused quite a stir among fans of the show - and even current castmates.\n\nHappier times: Sonia and Nick separated in January and their divorce was finalized in April\n\nEnd of it all: The two announced their split in a joint statement via Twitter in March, and Sonia added that people shouldn't be 'discouraged' by their divorce because 'this is still a love story'\n\nLook of love? Nick and Sonia said 'I do' as strangers on the fourth season of the reality series Married at First Sight\n\nSheila Downs, who married Nate Duhon on the current season of Married at First Sight, took to Twitter to share her disgust with Heather.\n\n'But she judges US??!? she was his life coach!!!! What a JOKE!!! She gave them advice about their marriage,' she wrote, prompting Nick to write back: '#inaccurate #alternativefacts God Bless You #mafs.'\n\nAnd when another fan said he 'had to have cheated on Sonia', Nick clapped back: 'Say what you will to make your day more exciting. This is #inaccurate and Sonia knows that too. Babies are miracles. Focus on that.'\n\n'It\u2019s nothing short of a blessing when a woman is told she can\u2019t have kids and then becomes pregnant with twins,' he wrote on Instagram. 'It\u2019s still early but we are so excited we couldn\u2019t hide it any longer.

The garden theme is a perennial one for spring and summer collections, and this season has been no exception with impressive installations of flowers and shrubbery flanking runways all over town and floral motifs sprouting like weeds.\n\nFashion farmer Siriano managed to harvest his garden twice this season. The first time was by incorporating some of the literal references \u2014 think grass-green suiting, sunflower-yellow dresses and a parade of psychedelic floral brocades. The second time was by tying into the idea of inclusivity, specifically the slogan, \u201cWe all grow in the same garden,\u201d which appeared on a cropped black hoodie worn by a model named Joel, who may have identified as male. Or female. Or neither.\n\nJoining Joel on the runway were models that reflected real-life shapes, sizes and skin tones: curvy women, statuesque women, women of color.\n\nLeslie Jones, Gina Gershon, Patricia Clarkson, Vanessa Williams and Jillian Hervey in the front row of Christian Siriano\u2019s spring 2018 runway show in New York on Sept. 9. (Jamie McCarthy / Getty Images)\n\nSiriano\u2019s message of inclusiveness has made him a kind of \u201cMary, Mary quite contrary\u201d of the fashion industry for some time now. After dressing actor Leslie Jones for the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d premiere in 2016 (the comedian had lamented on social media that no designer wanted to dress her), it became his calling card. And when he presented his fall and winter collection here in February, its standout \u201cpeople are people\u201d slogan tee and the fact that it was modeled by women of various sizes earned him a standing ovation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo it wasn\u2019t much of a surprise that Jones turned out for Siriano\u2019s show, sitting elbow to elbow with celebrities such as Patricia Clarkson, Gina Gershon and Vanessa Williams. What was a surprise \u2014 and made the show thoroughly entertaining \u2014 was Jones\u2019 responses to the various looks that came down the catwalk and her enthusiastic interaction with the models.\n\nLooks from the Christian Siriano spring 2018 runway collection.

At one point, her enthusiastic faux-coaching of supermodel Coco Rocha earned an extremely rare (but so well-deserved) breaking of the fourth wall between audience and model, with Rocha acknowledging her cheering section of one by lingering briefly in Jones\u2019 vicinity.\n\nForget the silver bells and cockle shells \u2014 to be honest, we\u2019re not exactly sure what a cockle shell is \u2014 we suspect Siriano\u2019s continued emphasis on diversity on the runway and inclusivity in creating clothes wearable by a wider range of customers will grow his garden significantly going forward.\n\nAs the runway filled for the finale walk \u2014 to the tune of Blur\u2019s \u201cGirls And Boys\u201d \u2014 there they were: pretty maids all in a row.\n\nadam.tschorn@latimes.com\n\nFor more musings on all things fashion and style, follow me at @ARTschorn.\n\nALSO:\n\nViva Avant Garde!

And since then, the Leftovers star has been pretty busy hunting for his new bae\u2014according to the media, at least.\n\nWith the end of a high-profile relationship like Jen and Justin\u2019s, rumors are par for the course, but the speculation surrounding Theroux is next level\u2014especially considering that his counterpart, Aniston, hasn\u2019t been romantically linked to anyone except for ex-husband Brad Pitt (and c\u2019mon guys, that\u2019s way too easy).\n\nSince announcing their split, Theroux has been linked to not one, but nine (9) different ladies (and one man), and surprise, surprise, most of the claims are ridiculous.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t had time to pore over each and every outlandish report, we\u2019ve done it for you. Behold, the complete history of Justin\u2019s rumored post-Jen dating life.\n\nGetty Images\n\nChloe Harstein\n\nNot two weeks post-split, rumors spread that Justin was dating his stylist Chloe Harstein. However, the rumors were just that: rumors. Theroux\u2019s reps confirmed to Gossip Cop that \u201cnothing is going on\u201d between the colleagues.\n\nAlexa Chung\n\nSoon after his and Jen\u2019s split, news broke that not only were he and Alexa Chung dating, but they were planning to have kids! Don\u2019t worry, this one got absolutely no traction after the initial reports.\n\nPetra Collins\n\nOne of the first, and perhaps the most viable of Theroux\u2019s rumored love interests, is 25-year-old Petra Collins. The Canadian artist/model/photographer and bestie to Selena Gomez (see below) has been spotted with the actor several times over the last few months, and even made a cameo on his Instagram feed just one week prior to his and Jen\u2019s announcement. Despite it all, sources insist Petra and Justin \u201care friends.\u201d\n\nAubrey Plaza\n\nThe Parks and Recreation star was spotted out with Theroux in late March, naturally sparking rumors of a romance. This particular strain of gossip died out quickly, though\u2014Plaza is reportedly still dating longtime boyfriend Jeff Baena, and a source told People that she and Justin only met to \u201cdiscuss a potential film project.\u201d Case closed.\n\nSelena Gomez\n\nLike Sel\u2019s pal Petra, she and Theroux are friends\u2014the kind that hang out in public and occasionally even crop up in each other\u2019s Instagram feeds. Questionable sources have maintained that Sel and the other Justin are \u201cfalling for each other,\u201d but we\u2019re really not getting that vibe. Plus, she and Jen Aniston go way back.\n\nEmma Stone\n\nBertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty Images\n\nEveryone is working really hard to make Emma Stone and Justin Theroux happen. The pair co-star in Netflix\u2019s upcoming series Maniac and sometimes hang out in bathing suits/at exclusive after-parties, but Theroux is the first to admit that they\u2019re \u201cBffffffs. JUST bfffffs.\u201d (Plus, there are also rumors that Stone and her ex, Andrew Garfield, are heating up again.)\n\nInstagram/justintheroux\n\nLaura Harrier\n\nHarrier has also logged some swimsuit-clad hours with Theroux (in France, no less), but a source recently told Entertainment Tonight that he and the Spiderman star aren\u2019t an item\u2014in fact, he\u2019s not in a relationship at all. \u201cJustin is not in a relationship,\u201d they revealed. \u201cHe\u2019s super social and loves meeting new people and collaborating on ideas with friends. These days he\u2019s been spending time with friends and family.\u201d\n\nJonathan Van Ness\n\nDia Dipasupil/Getty Images\n\nDespite the flirty nature of the Queer Eye star\u2019s Insta story with Theroux and Stone, again, \u201cJUST bfffffs.\u201d\n\nOlivia Munn\n\nSMXRF/Star Max/Getty Images\n\nInTouch received an \u201cinsider\u201d tip that Theroux had been \u201cleaning on Olivia Munn since leaving Jen,\u201d speculating that the former co-stars were more than friends. Munn was quick to shoot down the rumors though, setting the record straight with an Instagram story. \u201cDear Tabloids, Please stop matching me with my friends\u2019 exes,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNo disrespect to people who date their friends\u2019 exes, that\u2019s just not my style.\u201d\n\nErika Cardenas\n\nJustin sparked relationship buzz when he was spotted on a walk in N.Y.C. with 25-year-old model Erika Cardenas\u2014but alas, they\u2019re just friends. \u201cThere is no romantic relationship, just a friend from the gym,\u201d a source told People.

        "content": "It's time to celebrate Randall's favorite holiday!\n\nOn Tuesday's episode of This Is Us, titled \"Six Thanksgivings,\" the Pearsons' story spanned six different Thanksgiving dinners across several decades -- from the Vietnam War to the present day to various turkey meals from the past. While this year's family get-together at Randall's home was anything but traditional, we still learned quite a bit about our favorite TV family.\n\nSo what were the biggest revelations from the latest episode? Three major developments surfaced from the hour that may play into the rest of the season in a very meaningful way.\n\n1. The story behind Jack's mystery woman is revealed.\n\nNBC\n\nWe all presumed -- as did Kevin -- that the frayed photograph of Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) with the Vietnamese woman, who was wearing Jack's prized necklace, meant they had an intimate relationship of some sort. Did they forge something close to a friendship? Were they romantic? Did she have any relation to the mysterious \"her\" referenced in the distant future? It turns out, she was none of that. Instead, they were merely acquaintances. But how did an acquaintance make such an impact on Jack's life?\n\nDuring a makeshift Thanksgiving meal in Vietnam, Jack -- noticing the woman struggling with two heavy pails of water -- walks over to help her carry them to her shack, glaring at Nicky (Michael Angarano), who was in prime position to help, for not assisting her. A fellow soldier, who happened to have a camera in hand, snaps the picture that Kevin would receive decades later. At first, any theories suggesting any hint of romance between Jack and the woman were still in play.\n\nNoticing that she hasn't been catching any fish lately, Jack packs a turkey meal from the squad's leftovers for her and her family, and it's when he visits her home that he learns just how dire the condition of her son -- who had cut his foot on the barbwire fence -- is. After Nicky refuses to treat her (he later tells a story about a friend who trusted an older woman, only to die because she was an enemy informant), Jack furiously attempts to sterilize her son's infected cut. He successfully does so and as he is leaving, she gives him the necklace.\n\n2. The origins of Miguel and Rebecca's romance comes out.\n\nNBC\n\nWe learned last season that Miguel (Jon Huertas) and Rebecca (Mandy Moore) reconnected over Facebook, several years after Jack's death, but we never got a firm timeline. Tuesday's episode changed all that. During a conversation at the Thanksgiving dinner table with Miguel and his two grown children, he revealed -- after his son, who is a piece of work, had a snarky comeback about Miguel and Rebecca's marriage -- that they didn't become romantically involved until 10 years after Jack's death and after his ex, Shelly, remarried.\n\n\"First you steal my father from my mother and now you're trying to kill my brother-in-law,\" Miguel's son snarls. \"Sorry? Too soon.\" Oof.\n\n\"No, not too soon actually. After your mother and I split, I promised my best friend and myself that I would fight to keep you guys in my life and for a long time, I tried. I called every day, I sent Christmas gifts, I tried to plan things and I was lucky if I got an email back from you. So, after a while, I gave up,\" Miguel says. \"In heartbreak, 10 years after her husband and my best friend died, and your mother had remarried, Rebecca and I found each other and we filled a hole in each other's lives. You don't have to be happy for us but we're not going to apologize for being together. So take all the shots at me that you want to... But the one time a decade you see Rebecca, you show my wife some respect.\"\n\nPreach, Miguel, preach.\n\n3. Tess is hiding a big secret.\n\nNBC\n\nWith Randall, Beth, Annie and Deja out to serve a Thanksgiving meal to the less fortunate, Tess (Eris Baker) stays behind after saying she wasn't feeling very good. Turns out, she was experiencing her first period. After Toby (Chris Sullivan) accidentally walks in on her trying to figure out what to do about it, Kate (Chrissy Metz) shows her maternal side, teaching the older Pearson daughter what to do when that time of the month comes. But that turned out not to be the only thing Tess was going through.\n\nWhen Kate sweetly tells Tess that she can come to her for anything, that's when Tess shares a secret she hasn't told anyone. \"I know you have a mom, but if there's anything you ever want to talk to me about, any time. Pretty soon you're going to have your first kiss and your first boyfriend...,\" Kate says.\n\n\"Or... girlfriend,\" Tess says, catching Kate off guard. \"Or girlfriend,\" Kate replies. Later, when the two go downstairs to continue the Thanksgiving meal prep, Tess makes one request of her aunt: \"Don't tell mom and dad about... you know.\" \"I won't,\" Kate promises. \"But Tess, your parents are going to love you no matter what. So you should tell them.\" Will she -- and does it have anything to do with \"her\"?\n\nThis Is Us airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on NBC.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:",

The judge also ordered that the 28-year-old seek a mental health evaluation within two weeks of release.Sarah Palin\u2019s parents were present in court, according to KTUU, while Todd said via telephone that the family was prepared to reestablish contact with Track if he was released.\n\nHowever, the Associated Press reports that the judge denied Track\u2019s attorney requested his bail be lowered from $5,000. As of Wednesday afternoon, Palin was still in custody, reports the Anchorage Daily News.\n\nEMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAccording to documents obtained by The Blast, Track\u2019s ex-wife Britta Hanson got a protective order against him and created a safeword for their 6-year-old daughter, Kyla, to use if she felt in danger while with him during visits at his home.\n\nAccording to the documents, after Kyla spent the night with Track on Nov. 25, Hanson alleged that she went to pick up her daughter to find him \u201ccussing and yelling\u201d before he \u201cgrabbed me and pushed me into the wall.\u201d\n\nHanson says in the documents that she followed Track and their child to his parents\u2019 house, where Track started throwing tools and threatened to beat up Todd when they confronted him. After that, the family decided Track could spend supervised time with his daughter by having Kyla dropped off at Sarah and Todd\u2019s house, according to the documents.\n\nAccording to the documents, Hanson was granted a temporary protective order which states that Track must stay at least 500 feet from Hanson, her home and her workplace for 20 days until a full hearing on the protective order request.\n\nCQ Roll Call via AP Images\n\nTrack was arrested over the weekend on charges of domestic violence in relation to an incident that a source tells PEOPLE occurred at the Wasilla home of his parents. The former Alaska governor was the one who called the police to report the incident, which was over a disagreement regarding a truck Track wanted to pick up.\n\nA source close to the Palin family tells PEOPLE that the burglary charge came from allegedly breaking and entering at Sarah and Todd\u2019s home. As for the assault charge, \u201cTodd was the victim.\u201d Asked if Todd, who suffered life-threatening injuries in a serious snow machine crash last winter, was okay, the source replied: \u201cHe will be.\u201d\n\nThe insider added, \u201cA lot of other families have gone through worse.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Track has come in contact with the law. In January 2016, he was arrested after being accused of assaulting his girlfriend, Jordan Loewe, and pointing a gun at her. He\u2019s been serving two years of probation on a plea deal stemming from the arrest.",

It all started with her early roles like Girl, Interrupted and Tomb Raider, which established her as \"sexy and daring, confrontational and independent.\" That set the stage for everything else.\n\n2. Then she adopted Maddox. \"Suddenly, she seemed more mature, more beautiful, and more serious\" and made single motherhood look awesome. \"She was reframing single motherhood from a state of lack or insufficiency to a glamorous, unfettered lifestyle choice,\" Wolf suggests.\n\n3. She learned to fly a plane, which is the \"ultimate in single-mom chic.\" Also, Wolf points out that flying a plane is typically a man thing, so Angie is metaphorically making her own decisions without the help of men. Girl power!\n\n4. Then she chose the most perfect man who ever existed and didn't care about whether he was married. Yes, this makes her a homewrecker. But Wolf argues that Brad Pitt looked so good with the kids as the ultimate male role model that Angie was able to get away with it unscarred.\n\n5. Taking Brad as her lover was also Angie's big ef you to society and rules (like don't steal people's spouses). Break it down, Wolf-style: \"Jolie's evident disdain of that social constraint certainly, for better or worse, put her in the same self-entitled category as those men who have traditionally taken what they wanted and let the emotional chips fall where they may.\"\n\n6. And finally, by visiting Afghan refugees in Pakistan and penning op-eds about Darfur in Time, Angelina makes other female stars look lazy with their silly tanning and partying.\n\nAnd so, Angie is the \"ego ideal\" for ladies.

In fact, Swift often makes headlines for her alleged romances, despite the fact that many of the men she\u2019s been tied to haven\u2019t actually been her boyfriend.\n\nIn 2016, Taylor Swift started her year off with a romance with Calvin Harris, which had begun in 2015 after the former couple were introduced to one another at the Brit Awards. However, months into the year, rumors began swirling in regard to their potential split, and in early June, their breakup was confirmed.\n\n\u201cAdam really liked [Taylor Swift], she was not the type of girl he ever dates and he liked that. He liked how innocent Taylor was and that she had a good caring heart. Taylor\u2019s heart was more in it then he was. He started to lose interest over the past few months, but really tried to not just break up,\u201d a source told E! News at the time.\n\nFollowing the split, Taylor Swift began dating Tom Hiddleston, and the now-ex-couple enjoyed a whirlwind romance throughout the summer months. Then, in early September of last year, an E!

But right now everything between them is friendly. Working together is a definite future option, but that isn\u2019t happening yet either. Regardless, they are eating up the talk about it.\u201d\n\nTaylor Swift and Drake weren\u2019t seen together again following the appearance at the party, and the rapper has since been linked to Jennifer Lopez.\n\n[Featured Image by Jason Merritt/Getty Images]",

His co-stars Shannon Purser and Noah Schnapp took to Twitter to defend Wolfhard\u2018s actions, along with \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 Sophie Turner \u2013 arguing that all people \u2018need a break\u2019, especially when they\u2019re young.\n\n\u201cHey everybody!,\u201d Wolfhard has since posted on Twitter. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but you are for real you will harass my friends, or my co-workers. Y\u2019all know who you are.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u201cWhy I even have to tweet that, I don\u2019t know.

I don't wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but if you are for real you will not harass my friends, or co-workers. Ya'll know who you are. \u2014 Finn Wolfhard (@FinnSkata) November 8, 2017\n\nWhy I even have to tweet that, I don't know. Anyone who calls themselves a \"fan\" and actively goes after someone for literally acting and doing their job is ridiculous. Think b4 ya type boiiii \u2014 Finn Wolfhard (@FinnSkata) November 8, 2017\n\nDefending Wolfhard for not stopping to meet fans, co-star Shannon Purser who played Barb in season one wrote on Twitter: \u201cOkay, no. No actor is under any obligation to stop for anyone. Finn is an incredibly kind human. But he\u2019s human and he needs breaks too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI experience this on a significantly smaller scale, obviously, but I\u2019ve had people waiting for me in hotel lobbies, at my airport gate, etc. And I\u2019m an adult. I can\u2019t imagine being inundated with all this attention at his age. It\u2019s intimidating. So, from one big sister to the world, don\u2019t you DARE make young actors feel guilty or indebted to you because they couldn\u2019t say hi. They give you their art. They love their fans. Don\u2019t take advantage of that. And if you can\u2019t handle them needing space, stay away.\u201d",

        "content": "Taylor Swift released \"Call It What You Want\" at midnight tonight, her fourth Reputation single and her latest love song from the album. She also seemed to share footage of herself working on it that her current boyfriend Joe Alwyn possibly could've taken:\n\nAnd, at first glance, the lyrics seem to say quite a bit about her relationship with her current boyfriend Alwyn and her recovery after 2016's Kimye Snapchat and Calvin Harris/Hiddleswift blowouts.\n\nSwift has the sole writer credit on the track, so the single is likely at the very least inspired by her real-life experiences. And every word is packed with meaning. Here, the lyrics, with Joe Alwyn and Kimye references annotated, via Genius:\n\nMy castle crumbled overnight\n\nSwift's 1989 final track, \"New Romantics,\" first referenced this metaphoric castle with the lyric, \"'Cause, baby, I could build a castle/Out of all the bricks they threw at me/And every day is like a battle/But every night with us is like a dream.\"\n\nI brought a knife to a gunfight\n\nThe gunfight is likely a reference to the Snapchat receipts Kim Kardashian posted of Swift and Kanye West discussing the lyric about her in \"Famous\". Swift posted a Note after on her Instagram, where she wrote: \"Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me 'that bitch' in his song? It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone's emotional response to being called 'that bitch' in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot 'approve' a song you haven't heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009.\" That was not enough to stop criticism of her because of it.\n\nThey took the crown but it's alright\n\nAll the liars are calling me one\n\nSwift takes a pointed jab at Kimye here (as she wrote in her note after the Snapchats, \"Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination.\")\n\nNobody's heard from me for months\n\nSwift stayed out of the spotlight for much of 2017.

News of their relationship, which they kept secret for months, wouldn't break until May 2017. Swift suggests here that Alwyn was her refuge during the fall, and she spent her time off recovering and falling in love.\n\nMy baby's fly like a jet stream\n\nHigh above the whole scene\n\nAlwyn is an up and coming British actor, while Swift's other boyfriends have been more famous and in the Hollywood/A-list world (Tom Hiddleston, Joe Jonas, Calvin Harris, and Harry Styles particularly.)\n\nLoves me like I'm brand new\n\nSo call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to\n\nVerse 2:\n\nAll my flowers grew back as thorns\n\nWindows boarded up after the storm\n\nHe built a fire just to keep me warm\n\nAll the drama queens taking swings\n\nDrama queens here could be a reference to Kim Kardashian and her other rival, Katy Perry, who talked extensively about Swift and their feud during her Witness press tour.\n\nAll the jokers dressing up as kings\n\nJokers could be a reference to Kanye West but also Calvin Harris, one of the world's highest paid DJs, and her other ex who caused quite a bit of drama for her in 2016.\n\nThey fade to nothing when I look at him\n\nAnd I know I make the same mistakes every time\n\nBridges burn, I never learn\n\nSwift is referring her to her dating track record and perhaps her most recent failed relationships with Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston (and the songs she wrote about them, like her other exes).\n\nAt least I did one thing right, I did one thing right\n\nI'm laughing with my lover\n\nMaking forts under covers\n\nTrust him like a brother\n\nSwift and her own real brother Austin Swift are very close.\n\nWith Austin at a 2014 Golden Globes After Party Getty Images\n\nYeah, you know I did one thing right\n\nStarry eyes sparking up my darkest night\n\nChorus:\n\nCause my baby's fit like a daydream\n\nWalking with his head down\n\nI'm the one he's walking to\n\nSo call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to\n\nMy baby's fly like a jet stream\n\nHigh above the whole scene\n\nLoves me like I'm brand new\n\nSo call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to\n\nBridge:\n\nI want to wear his initial on a chain around my neck\n\nChain round my neck\n\nNot because he owns me\n\nBut 'cause he really knows me\n\nFans on Genius point out that Swift has been photographed wearing a silver chain in her Reputation promo photo (and in the personal footage Swift shared with the release of \"Call It What You Want\"), one they think Alwyn gave her.\n\nNote the silver necklace in all these photos. music.directv.com // Twitter\n\nSwift previously wore a paper airplane necklace when she was dating Harry Styles that inspired song lyrics before, so there's precedent.\n\nWhich is more than they can say\n\nI recall late November\n\nHolding my breath, slowly I said \"you don't need to save me\n\nBut would you run away with me?\"\n\nYes\n\nLate November is Swift's hint this is when they first seriously got together. \"Would you run away with me?\" could be a reference to their time spent undercover and privately in England when they first started dating.\n\nChorus:\n\nMy baby's fit like a daydream\n\nWalking with his head down\n\nI'm the one he's walking to\n\nSo call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to\n\nMy baby's fly like a jet stream\n\nHigh above the whole scene\n\nLoves me like I'm brand new\n\nSo call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to\n\nCall it what you want, call it what you want\n\nCall it what you want, call it what you want\n\nCall it what you want, call it what you want\n\nCall it what you want, call it what you want\n\nCall it what you want yeah, call it what you want to",

        "content": "John Cena is having a change of heart!\n\nIn a sneak peek of Sunday's episode of Total Bellas, the 41-year-old star meets with his ex-fiance, Nikki Bella, to discuss what led to their breakup. In earlier episodes of the E! reality series, it was made known that one of the main reasons the two were calling it quits was because John was not open to starting a family.\n\n\"I don't think date nights could ever get old, but I think so many years down the road, to keep things exciting, I think kids help that in a relationship,\" Nikki, 34, tells John. \"I see the point of kids after you've been with someone for so long.\"\n\nJohn's main fear, it turns out, is that if he does agree to kids, Nikki will \"get bored\" of him regardless.\n\n\"In a hypothetical universe, say I was like, \u2018OK, we're going to have kids,' and we do and you find out that wasn't the real problem. And then years from now you look at me and resent [me],\" John explains. \"So, I'm talking to you tonight and I'm trying to ask all of these difficult questions because I don't know if you're just upset that you're not going to be a mom or if you've fallen out of love with me. Because it kind of feels like both. There's no way that I can interpret your actions over the last three months as anything different.\"\n\nNikki assures John that she \"just want[s] to be a mom.\"\n\n\"To constantly wake up and just look at this beautiful thing that I made and to teach him new things,\" she says dreamily.\n\n\"It's going to be a him? You said him,\" John points out.\n\nThe reality star tells her former flame, \"I feel like there's so much more I want to do with you and experience with you. It's just wanting to be a mom and knowing you will not be a dad.\"\n\nNikki adds, \"So, it's me who has stuck around thinking I could be OK with it and I've just come to the realization that I'm not OK with it.\"\n\nWith that declaration, John makes a jaw-dropping statement of his own.\n\n\"So, it literally is just about being a mom?\" the Blockers star asks. \"OK, because I can't have you out of my life, ever, and I want to marry you. Relationship and marriage especially is about sacrifice, and I will make that sacrifice for you. I will give you a child.\"\n\nJohn's apparent new view regarding children comes nearly two months after the pair split in April. Since then, the pro wrestler has expressed his willingness to have children.\n\n\"I'm willing to go back on all of these things I said, and a lot of things I was holding on to just out of stubbornness -- 'I won't have kids' -- and it took a really strong look in the mirror for me to be like, 'Why?'\" he said on Today back in May. \"This person is my number one, and it's something that's very valuable to her, and of course we can do this ... all of that switched because I love her. She's my number one and I just want to make her happy ... and right now, she's happy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Nikki said the time would heal all wounds for the couple.\n\n\"It's going to take time. So, honestly, only time can tell,\" she told ET following her ex's Today show appearance. \"John and I, we absolutely love each other and we care about each other a lot. We are best friends and, right now, we're both giving each other time separately and maybe there's hope that we reunite in the future.\"\n\nLast month, a rep for Nikki revealed to ET that the WWE stars are \"working on their relationship.\"\n\n\"Nikki Bella and John Cena are working on their relationship and taking it day by day,\" the rep said. \"They appreciate all of their fans and their continued support.\"\n\nHere's more on their possible reconciliation:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:",

While the end of the show made our hearts break (and we'd be lying if we said we're over it), this sweet reunion between the two responsible for our heartbreak is a step in the right direction.\n\nRead more: A live-action \u2018Kim Possible\u2019 movie is in the works\n\nFor those of you who didn't obsessively watch the show (we can't imagine why), the show followed the lives of the Diffy family, a futuristic family from the year 2121 who got stuck in the year 2004 after their time machine broke during a family vaction.\n\nDuring their time in 2004, Phil meets his best friend, Keely, and let's just say we shipped them before we even knew shipping was a thing. To make a long story short, the show ended with the two confessing their feelings for one another and Phil going back to the future, which completely broke our hearts.\n\n^The moment our hearts swooned and broke at the same time^\n\nWhile we're still not over the fact that these two didn't get a happy ending, Aly Michalka and Raviv Ullman made up for our childhood heartbreak by giving us this sweet reunion\u2026\n\nUllman posted the moment onto his Instagram, which made our Disney Channel nostalgia hit us all at once (especially because it featured Aly's sister and music partner, AJ, which you might remember the sisters as being the rocking duo of Aly and AJ). As Teen Vogue explains, the reason for this wonderful reunion was because of the AMO Ferragamo party Tuesday night.\n\nThis isn't the first time the pair have hung out, though. In an interview with Teen Vogue back in 2017, Michalka told the publication that \u201cRaviv and I keep in touch; we're Instagram buddies. Whenever I'm in New York or he's in L.A., we try to see each other and get lunch.\u201d\n\nIf that isn't enough to completely make your heart sing, the added possibility of a real deal reunion might not be that far out.\n\nMichalka also told TV that she wouldn't be opposed to a Phil Of The Future reunion, saying: \u201cI mean, sure! I guess reunions are a big thing now. I wouldn't be opposed to it. It's a funny idea. I have no idea what they'd do necessarily with the storyline, but yeah, sure.\u201d\n\nWhile this isn't exactly the reunion we were looking for, we'll take it\u2014and who knows, maybe this might spark Disney to get the cast back together sometime before the year 2121 and make a few new episodes of the show\u2026",

        "content": "Story highlights Raisman says she was sexually abused by Nassar, including at the London Olympics Separately, Jacob Moore is the first male gymnast to join a federal suit against Nassar\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nOlympic gold-winning gymnast Aly Raisman has filed a lawsuit against the US Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics, disgraced doctor Larry Nassar and others, alleging the committee at its highest levels was aware that Nassar had molested gymnasts who participated with USA Gymnastics.\n\nThe suit was filed Wednesday in Santa Clara County Superior Court in California.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Nassar, the former doctor for Michigan State University athletics and the national gymnastics team, sexually abused Raisman at the Karolyi Ranch in Texas, national and international competitions and the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nRaisman is a two-time Olympian who won medals in London and Rio de Janeiro, including team gold in each of those Games.\n\n\u201cMy highest priority has been to push for change, so future generations of athletes will be safer,\u201d Raisman said in a statement. \u201cIt has become painfully clear that these organizations have no intention of properly addressing this problem. After all this time, they remain unwilling to conduct a full investigation, and without a solid understanding of how this happened, it is delusional to think sufficient changes can be implemented.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, thousands of young athletes continue to train and compete every day in this same broken system. I refuse to wait any longer for these organizations to do the right thing. It is my hope that the legal process will hold them accountable and enable the change that is so desperately needed.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Raisman\u2019s attorney, John Manly, accused the USOC and USA Gymnastics of \u201ca conspiracy to silence victims and cover up the largest child sex abuse scandal in history.\u201d\n\n\u201cA simple fact is this: If USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee had followed their own bylaws, policies and procedures designed to protect children from sexual abuse, Ms. Raisman never would have met him, never would have been \u2018treated\u2019 by him and never would have been molested by him,\u201d Manly said.\n\n\u201cInstead they conspired to hide their knowledge of Nassar\u2019s horrible crimes from the public and attempted to frighten Ms. Raisman and other victims into keeping quiet. USOC and USAG can and will be made accountable by our justice system.\u201d\n\nUSA Gymnastics declined to comment on Raisman\u2019s lawsuit Friday but offered support to athletes who have been abused by Nassar. \u201cUSA Gymnastics is committed to doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again by making bold decisions and holding ourselves to the highest standards of care,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nCNN also reached out to the US Olympic Committee for comment. Previously, USA Gymnastics, the Olympic Committee and Michigan State have denied wrongdoing in the Nassar scandal.\n\nThe US Olympic Committee announced Wednesday that CEO Scott Blackmun is stepping down for health reasons. In late January, the entire membership of the USA Gymnastics board of directors resigned, as required by the USOC in a move to improve the organization and provide a safe environment for gymnasts.\n\nUSA Gymnastics terminated its agreement with the Karolyi Ranch in January. Marta and Bela Karolyi, longtime gymnastics coaches for Team USA, are retired.\n\nNassar, 54, pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges and 10 counts of criminal sexual conduct in two state court cases in Michigan. He\u2019s in prison in Tucson, Arizona, serving a 60-year sentence for the federal charges.\n\nIf he\u2019s still alive when he finishes his federal sentence, Nassar will have to return to Michigan to serve sentences for sex crimes. He was sentenced to 40 to 125 years in Eaton County, Michigan, where nearly 200 girls and women made statements about how his sexual abuse had changed their lives.\n\nThat sentence will run concurrently with the 40- to 175-year sentence from nearby Ingham County. In the latter case, Nassar pleaded guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct \u2013 three of which involved victims under age 13 \u2013 and admitted to using his stature as a medical professional to assault and molest girls under the guise of medical treatment.\n\nFirst male gymnast joins suit against Nassar\n\nSeparately, the first male gymnast has joined a civil federal suit against Nassar and others associated with the sex abuse scandal of the former Michigan State and USA Gymnastics doctor.\n\nFiled Wednesday, the complaint alleges Jacob Moore was treated multiple times by Nassar in a Twistars gym, at the Michigan State University Sports Medicine Clinic and in Nassar\u2019s home. It was there, according to the suit, that Nassar \u201cpulled down Plaintiff Jacob Moore\u2019s pants, exposing his genitalia, explaining to Jacob Moore that he was doing this to treat his shoulder pain through acupuncture in his pubic area and in and around his genitalia.\u201d\n\nMoore was a minor at the time, and this was done after another minor female gymnast came into the basement where he was being treated, the suit says.\n\n\u201cThere is no known medical connection between shoulder pain which can be treated through acupuncture in the area of a male\u2019s genitalia,\u201d the suit says. \u201cPlaintiff Jacob Moore believes the conduct of Dr. Nassar was sexual assault, battery, abuse, molestation and harassment performed by Defendant Nassar for Defendant Nassar\u2019s sexual pleasure and gratification.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s sister, Kamerin, a member of USA Gymnastics from 2003-2014, first testified about her and her brother\u2019s victimization during Nassar\u2019s criminal trial in Ingham County in January. She also joined the federal civil suit.\n\nJacob Moore has been a member of USA Gymnastics since 2006 and trained at the Twistars gym from 2001 through 2015.\n\nThe allegations were made in an amended civil federal complaint filed against Nassar. Defendants include Michigan State, the university\u2019s board of trustees, USA Gymnastics and others associated with the scandal. USA Gymnastics also declined to comment on Moore\u2019s complaint.\n\nThe suit, which has several other plaintiffs, seeks declaratory, injunctive, equitable and monetary relief for injuries.",

(Video: The Washington Post)\n\nShare Add to your saved stories Save\n\nWeeks ago, \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d booked Gayle King to chat about the holidays and her best friend Oprah\u2019s list of \u201cfavorite things\u201d for 2017. Then, hours before King\u2019s appearance, her \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d co-anchor Charlie Rose was fired after an extensive Washington Post report detailed his alleged unwanted sexual advances toward women.\n\nClearly, the \u201cLate Show\u201d conversation had to take a much different turn \u2014 as a result, King admitted she wanted to bail.\n\n\u201cStephen, I came this close to canceling,\u201d King said at the top of the interview on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Colbert assured her, and recapped what transpired over the last 24 hours: After Rose was accused by eight different women of sexual harassment in a Post story that published Monday, CBS fired him and PBS dropped his \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d talk show. Colbert noted that King and her other \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d co-anchor, Norah O\u2019Donnell, had to cover the story on-air Tuesday morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been easy,\u201d Colbert said.\n\nKing agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s still very hurtful. Charlie and I, we\u2019ve worked together, been friends. But when you think about the anguish of those women, despite the friendship, you still have to report the news,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to cancel, because I didn\u2019t want to be sitting here talking about this. But when you think about the job we do at CBS, and how hard the people work \u2026 we are a top-notch broadcast operation. And that\u2019s why I thought it was important to be here.\u201d\n\nStill, King wasn\u2019t a fan of Colbert\u2019s Rose jokes in his monologue. Earlier, Colbert had read an excerpt from the Post story that alleged Rose once invited a woman to his house and suggested they watch a DVD of his show. \u201cWhat woman alive doesn\u2019t get aroused by an hour-long interview with Thomas Friedman?\u201d Colbert cracked. Colbert also played a fake theme song for Charlie Rose\u2019s show: \u201cHere comes Charlie, oh no!/He\u2019s gettin\u2019 naked, open robe, he\u2019s a creep!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was wincing at your monologue, though, Stephen,\u201d King told him.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cWell, you did your job this morning, I did my job tonight,\u201d Colbert said.\n\n\u201cI thought about that, too,\u201d King said, adding that she laughed when Colbert made fun of others in his monologue. \u201cThen it was Charlie and I thought \u2018Oh, he\u2019s a friend \u2014 I don\u2019t like that.\u2019 That\u2019s difficult. And then I think about what these women were going through. I don\u2019t like that either.\u201d\n\nThe two discussed how the shocking day had unfolded, which included raw and emotional on-air statements from King and O\u2019Donnell. King, who said she\u2019s feeling a mix of anger, sadness, compassion and concern, revealed there was a company meeting Tuesday afternoon where everyone gathered in the conference room to process the day\u2019s events.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all sort of reeling about what has happened. It\u2019s a stunning thing what happened in 24 hours. Monday, your world is one way, and in 24 hours, Charlie has been suspended and then he has been fired. Charlie Rose, who was an icon in this country,\u201d King said. \u201cI\u2019m still wrapping my brain around that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, King said, she\u2019s also thinking about the women who told their stories. \u201cI applaud them for speaking up. If anything changes in this, what I do hope is that people will speak up and that companies are sending a message that, \u2018We have zero tolerance for this kind of behavior.\u2019 And that is a very important thing,\u201d she said.\n\nBefore they eventually segued into much lighter topics \u2014 such as Oprah\u2019s favorite things \u2014 Colbert asked whether King thinks the Harvey Weinstein revelations have sparked a permanent change in people\u2019s willingness to talk about sexual harassment.\n\n\u201cWomen are no longer afraid to speak up. But the best part about it is they are now being believed. They are now being believed. That\u2019s big,\u201d King said. \u201cBut it has to be more than just a bunch of women talking about this issue. We really do need men to join this conversation. Nothing is going to change until men join the conversation, too, and more women are in places of power. That, also, is something that I think will change.\u201d",

We\u2019d be on the [press] tour together, I\u2019d come back to the hotel, and the last thing I want to talk about or think about is a movie.\u201d\n\nRelated: Hottest Couples Who Fell in Love on Set From Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux to Nina Dobrev and Ian Somerhalder, see which stars have found love on set\n\n\u201cHe comes back from the tour, and that\u2019s all he wants to talk about and I get it,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s his baby.

I was doing double duty trying to be a supportive partner, while also being like, \u2018Can I please, for the love of God, not think about mother! for one second?\u2019\u201d\n\nLawrence said that reading the reviews made her be extra protective of him, so she had to put an end to it. \u201cI finally was just like, \u2018It\u2019s not healthy. Neither of us are doing it because if I read it, I start getting defensive.\u2019 Especially because it\u2019s my man,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome, what we did \u2014 some people hate it and the people who hate it, really hate it. But it\u2019s nothing that needs to be defended and if I read a negative review, I just feel defensive.\u201d\n\nThe American Hustle actress and the Black Swan director, 48, first met on the set of the psychological horror film. They sparked dating rumors in September 2016, and two months later they were spotted kissing in New York City. \u201cThey get along really well,\u201d a source told Us at the time.\n\nRelated: Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s Best Dresses!

Not to be dramatic, but I was dead. I was on that ground dead.\u201d\n\nLuckily for Harper, two doctors who were in the gym at the time were able to perform CPR and administer a defibrillator before paramedics arrived to take him to the hospital.\n\n\u201cIt was super scary for me because I woke up and I was so confused,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like Dory from 'Finding Nemo' because I had this short-term memory, so I was reliving the heart attack over and over again.\u201d\n\nHarper later discovered that he had suffered from the sudden cardiac arrest because he had high levels of a particle in his blood known as lipoprotein(a), a condition that is hereditary. (Harper\u2019s mother died of a heart attack.)\n\nHe told Savannah that it was \"hugely shocking\" to him that he'd suffered a heart attack.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about myself,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about the fact that genetics played a part in this. It is so important to know your health.\u201d\n\nHarper was in a medically induced coma for two days after being admitted to the hospital, and had two stents placed to keep his coronary arteries open and to reduce the risk of a future heart attack.\n\nIn the weeks and months following, Harper documented his progress on social media as he slowly worked his way back to wellness.\n\n\"It's been hard,\u201d he told Savannah. \"I'm going through some depression.

Well, she may be now after Swifties freaked after she possibly dissed her former BFF Taylor in a new Insta post!\n\nWell, Karlie Kloss definitely wasn\u2019t cleaning up bottles with Taylor Swift on New Years Day\u2026 instead, the model was posting a video from her LOVE Advent Calendar shoot, which featured a black and white film of Karlie showing off her basketball skills. Karlie, 24, titled the sexy snap \u201cSwish swish Love Advent \u201917 thank you,\u201d which spurred a dramatic response from Taylor Swift fans, because of the reference to Katy Perry\u2018s recent diss track \u201cSwish, Swish.\u201d Now, it\u2019s unclear if Karlie purposefully used the lyrics to Katy\u2019s collab with Nicki Minaj, that was specifically aimed at Taylor, but Tay\u2019s loyal army is not having it. \u201cThis is just sad why couldn\u2019t she have used a different caption?\u201d One user commented on the video with several sad emojis, while another wrote, \u201cThis is the worst thing you could do to a friend.\u201d\n\nIt is important to point out, as many of Karlie\u2019s defenders did, that \u201cswish swish\u201d is a clever reference to basketball and makes for a cute caption, and is not necessarily referencing Katy Perry\u2019s song. However, this isn\u2019t the first time recently that Karlie and Taylor\u2019s friendship has been questioned. Over July 4th weekend, when Taylor typically has her squad over to her Newport, RI home, Karlie was with Kendall Jenner, the sister of Taylor\u2019s arch-nemesis Kim Kardashian, and fans were furious, feeling like this was a direct hit at Tay. Another clue into their crumbling relationship was that Karlie\u2019s name was clearly absent from Taylor\u2019s Junior Jewels T-shirt, which included Gigi [Hadid], Ed [Sheeran], Blake [Lively] & other close friends, in her \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d video. Still, Karlie did make an effort to wish Taylor a happy birthday on Dec. 13, 2017, by posting a photo to Instagram and Twitter, but this caption could definitely be intentional shade at her former bestie. So sad!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Karlie was purposefully shading Taylor with her caption? Let us know!",

Ariana Grande supported Pete Davidson after wisdom teeth surgery, and the resulting photos are hilarious. It's not currently known how many teeth the comedian had pulled, but it was obviously enough to make him a little more groggy than usual. Grande and Davidson, true to form, documented the entire experience on social media, and honestly? It's the most relatable the couple has seemed yet. Unlike so many aspects of their relationship, this one brings out a resounding #beenthere from fans.\n\nGrande began to nurse Davidson to health after his surgery on Friday, July 13 according to their Instagram posts. They took a few goofy photos of Davidson with filters, but he napped through most of the day. This gave Grande the opportunity to post extensive photos of him sleeping. Not in a creepy way! Just in a, Aww, my poor baby, look at him type of way. True to his nature, Davidson joked his way through it all \u2014 though there's no way he wasn't in pain. \"Why did the doctor put this thing around my face like it's the 1920s?\" Davidson asked on Instagram, accompanied by a photo of him asleep with his mouth fully open while Grande looks on, sympathetic.\n\nTake a look at some photos from Ariana Grande nursing Pete Davidson back to health after surgery, and side note: Please enjoy the variety of celebrities that have commented on the saga.\n\nPete Davidson/Instagram; Bustle/Screenshot\n\nIn case you're just skimming the comments, know Judd Apatow, Jonathan Van Ness, Tan France, and Academy Award nominee Taraji P. Henson, have all weighed in on Davidson's healing process. Davidson has worked with Apatow before, and has grown close to the Queer Eye stars in the last few months, but Taraji P. Henson? How did that relationship happen \u2014 was it just her amazing job hosting Saturday Night Live? That friendship is incredible, and weirdly charming and the Grande-Davidson household needs to hit the town with Henson immediately. After Davidson is healed, of course. Because, uh, that's gonna take more than an afternoon of napping.\n\nDavidson and Grande is spending a lot of time together these days \u2014 they're seemingly inseparable \u2014 and it's still cute AF. Depending on how long you believe they've been together, you might think this public tour of affection is either their honeymoon phase or sweet relief at finally being able to go public. In addition to getting through the major surgery \u2014 presumably scheduled over the summer so as not to conflict with Davidson's rigorous SNL schedule \u2014 the pair just went for new tattoos together again. Grande added the numbers \"8418\" to her foot, which corresponds to the numbers Davidson already has on his arm. (8418 was the badge number of his late father, a firefighter who passed away on September 11th, 2001.) They also have matching cloud tattoos and tattoos for each other, including one on Grande that is reportedly in Davidson's handwriting.\n\nAriana Grande / Instagram Story\n\nAnyone that's had even one wisdom tooth extracted knows it's not a pleasant experience. Having any type of surgery isn't exactly a day at the beach, but there's something about intense oral surgery that just takes a little more out of you. There's painkillers and drooling and the soft-foods-only rule, and that's all before the face swelling that \u2014 as unpleasant as it is hilarious \u2014 indicates that you're healing properly. The surgery also marks the first time most people will learn of \"dry socket,\" a terrifying and legitimate medical concern brought on by using straws too soon after surgery. Most people would be achy and woozy and unattractive to anyone in the vicinity, but most people are not Pete Davidson, aka the love of Ariana Grande's life.",

To be honest, we're not totally surprised. What would YOU do if you ran into an ex at an intimate gathering? Probably the same thing these two did and that is avoid each other at all costs.\n\nRELATED: Drake Admits That He Still Loves Rihanna\n\nThe Shade Room posted a few seconds of the footage with the caption, \"#PressPlay #Rihanna and #Drake were spotted at a kids party today! They arrived separately, Riri came with her bestie. Drake looks like he was caught off guard ??.\"\n\nRihanna and Drake have known each other for a long time and he's professed his love for the songstress more than once. Most notably at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards when the \"One Dance\" singer presented Rihanna with the Video Vanguard Award. There was speculation that these two were dating at the time. After the show, they were seen getting dinner alone.\n\nHowever, things reportedly fizzled out and no one really knows what went down between them. In August, a source told E! News, \"Rihanna and Drake are seeing other people at the moment. They are not exclusive anymore. They still love each other, but their schedules have gotten in the way. Anything can change between them though, for better or worse. They are still in each other's lives.\"\n\nRELATED: Drake Reveals the Most Unexpected Birthday Surprise\n\nSince then, Drake has been romantically linked to India Love and Jennifer Lopez while Rihanna has stayed publicly single. Clearly, things have changed between them considering how little time they spent together at the birthday bash.\n\nNo one is quite sure what their status is and if they even acknowledged each other at the gathering. However, we do know that these two are just living their lives exactly like they want at the moment. Both focusing on their careers, friends and family. Because there is so much history between them, we have a feeling these two will be seen hanging out together sooner rather than later.

Most stories \u2014 including the popular \u201cMissing Richard Simmons\u201d podcast \u2014 theorized as to why he suddenly became so reclusive. Two publications, though, offered an answer. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight In June 2016 and March 2017, sister tabloids National Enquirer and Radar Online published a series of stories claiming Simmons was busy undergoing \u201cshocking sex surgery\u201d \u2014 receiving breast implants, hormone treatments and considering medical castration as he transitioned from male to female. The publications referred to him as \u201cthe new Caitlyn Jenner\u201d and said he was \u201cnow living as a gal named Fiona.\u201d\n\nAccompanying these stories were several photographs, including those of Simmons wearing a black dress and a coral wig. Simmons, of course, is well-known for wearing outrageous outfits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichard Simmons says he did not get a sex change.\n\nOn Monday, he filed a libel lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court against American Media, the owner of National Enquirer and Radar Online, for these \u201ccruel and malicious\u201d articles. He is seeking compensatory and punitive damages along with a retraction of the stories, an apology and an injunction.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed the publications \u201ccheaply and crassly commercialized and sensationalized an issue that ought to be treated with respect and sensitivity.\u201d\n\nThe suit claims the publications chose to paint Simmons as transgender because his history of supporting the LGBT community would make it more difficult for him to sue. (Simmons has never spoken openly about his own sexual identity. He has danced around the issue, though, such as when he told Wendy Williams that \u201cany moment I could just go right up in flames.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf he were to deny such a rumor, therefore, it might appear that Simmons thought being transgender was a negative thing.\n\n\u201cFor Mr. Simmons to sue, the National Enquirer and Radar Online have cynically calculated, will make Mr. Simmons appear to maintain that there is something wrong with transitioning from one gender to another,\u201d the lawsuit stated. \u201cTo remain passive and do nothing, the calculation continues, will be seen as tacitly conceding the truth of the stories, encouraging more of them.\u201d\n\nIt continued, \u201cNational Enquirer and Radar Online have miscalculated.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Simmons made a rare public statement against the stories as early as June 2016. In a Facebook post, he reaffirmed his own support of the LGBT community and asked his followers to join him \u2014 particularly in the wake of the June 12, 2016, Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAlthough I am not transitioning, I have and always will be supportive of those who are going through their journey,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe should not lose focus on showing love, strength and compassion to all of the LGBT community during these tragic times. My broken heart and healing thoughts are with the people of Orlando and all other victims of prejudice, bigotry and hate.\u201d\n\nThe publications defended themselves in a statement claiming that for Simmons to say \u201chis privacy has been invaded is hypocritical when his entire livelihood is based upon the public consumption of his image.\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\nIt added that Simmons\u2019s retreat from public life is \u201ca legitimate news story that demands coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, it is ironic that Mr. Simmons claims to be an avid supporter of the LGBTQ community while at the same time alleges that he was defamed by report that he had transitioned into a female,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe statement concluded that the stories were \u201cbased on credible sources who were in Mr. Simmons\u2019 inner circle.\u201d\n\nThat source, according to Simmons\u2019s lawsuit, is Mauro Oliveira, a man who for years \u201cblackmailed, extorted, and stalked\u201d Simmons, beginning in May 2015, \u201cwith the intention of destroying career and reputation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Oliveira contacted the National Enquirer on at least three separate occasions offering three separate stories as to why Mr. Simmons has been absent from the media in the past few years,\u201d the lawsuit stated.\n\nThe first story said Simmons was \u201cfrail, weak and spiritually broken\u201d and \u201cin desperate need of help.\u201d The second claimed Simmons was being held hostage by his housekeeper who engaged in witchcraft \u2014 a rumor repeated on the hit podcast about his disappearance.\n\n\u201cWhile pitching around these ideas, Mr. Oliveira was simultaneously blackmailing Mr. Simmons, sending him emails and threatening to destroy his reputation with damaging press coverage unless Mr. Simmons paid Mr. Oliveira to stop,\u201d the lawsuit stated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Oliveira responded to People magazine: \u201cThe allegations are false, and the real story about Richard Simmons will come out eventually.)\n\nAmerica Media is no stranger to lawsuits. The company remains in a legal battle with Phil McGraw (Dr. Phil) and his wife, Robin, who sued the National Enquirer for $250 million after the publication claimed that McGraw abused his wife.\n\nNonetheless, the company announced it will continue its investigation into Simmons.\n\n\u201cWe stand by our reporting about Mr. Simmons, and intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit and win public vindication of our reports,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe will also aggressively pursue our ongoing investigation into his life and who is really behind this bizarre and meritless lawsuit.\u201d\n\nMore from Morning Mix",

        "content": "Article Summary\n\nX\n\nTo make a neat and tidy top knot bun, comb your hair back from your forehead and pull it into a high ponytail, close to the top of your head. Secure the ponytail in place with an elastic hairband. Next, divide the hair into two equal sections. To make them smoother and easier to work with, work a little mousse or styling cream through each of the sections. Grab the sections in both hands and twist them around each other, passing one over the other until the entire length of your ponytail makes one long, twisted section. Take the twisted hair and wrap it clockwise around the elastic at the base of your ponytail. Tuck the end of the hair under the topknot, then pin the knot in place with several bobby pins that match your hair color. Spritz the bun with hairspray to give it extra hold and prevent fly-aways. If you want a messier, more voluminous topknot, back-comb your ponytail before you wrap it. Put your hair into a ponytail like you would for a regular topknot, then divide it into four sections. Grab each section one at a time and hold it straight up, then gently work a comb backwards down the length of the hair to tease it up. When you\u2019re done, use a brush to gently smooth the very top layer of the ponytail, which will make your backcombed hair easier to work with. Take your ponytail and wrap it clockwise around the elastic hairband, then tuck the end of the ponytail under the elastic. Pin your messy bun in place with several bobby pins that match your hair. You can also create a fuller-looking topknot using a hair doughnut. Slide the doughnut over the base of your ponytail, then backcomb your hair like you would for a messy topknot. Wrap your hair clockwise around the doughnut, making sure to cover the doughnut completely. Tuck the end of the ponytail under the doughnut and pin it in place with bobby pins. Spray on some hairspray to help keep your topknot in place. If you want to learn more from our Cosmetologist co-author, like how to use a hair donut to help shape your bun, keep reading!",

According to those reports, in fact, the Queen enjoyed the series though clucked her tongue, predictably at some of the \u201cheavily dramatized\u201d historical liberties. The Crown star Claire Foy didn\u2019t trust the rumors, telling Vanity Fair: \u201cI will believe it when I see it is all I\u2019ll say.\u201d Well perhaps after this year\u2019s Christmas speech in which the Queen appears to have included a cute little nod to Season 2, Foy will believe she has a royal fan.\n\nIn the fifth episode of the most recent season of The Crown, Foy\u2019s version of The Queen gives a disastrous and stiff speech to workers at a car factory. At the time and as depicted in the episode, royal critic Lord Altrincham suggested one solution to the Queen\u2019s communication difficulties was to televise her annual Christmas message\u2014which she has done ever since. In this year\u2019s speech, many suspect, the Queen paid direct homage to that Season 2 plot.\n\nThe Queen opened by saying: \u201cSixty years ago today, a young woman spoke about the speed of technological change as she presented the first television broadcast of its kind. She described the moment as a landmark. Six decades on, the presenter has \u2018evolved\u2019 somewhat, as has the technology she described.\u201d Don\u2019t let the third person fool you, the Queen is talking of herself here, and of a moment Foy embodied beautifully for Netflix.\n\nNow it\u2019s entirely possible that someone else\u2014savvy to the show\u2014slipped that reference in on the Queen\u2019s behalf.

        "content": "When the first season of Big Little Lies ended in the spring of 2017, fans of the buzzy miniseries figured that was that. After all, the debut season was marketed as a one-off miniseries, and it had adapted the entirety of the Liane Moriarty novel on which is was based. But months later, HBO surprised us all by revealing the show would get a second season. While we are still waiting for this new season to premiere, now fans are left with another pressing question: how much longer will the show go on? Will Big Little Lies Season 3 happen or is Season 2 where we will have to say goodbye to Monterey? Nicole Kidman talked about the future of the series in a recent interview, and it does not sound like fans should hold out much hope for more new seasons.\n\nThe biggest hurdle to keeping Big Little Lies going after its upcoming second season, it sounds like, is the hectic schedules of the cast. The ensemble drama boasts one of the most star-studded casts on television, and all of its stars are still putting out multiple blockbuster or critically acclaimed movies each year alongside their new TV jobs. The cast includes Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern, Shailene Woodley, and Zo\u00eb Kravitz, among others, and Season 2 will see none other than Meryl Streep joining the series as well.\n\nWith all of those huge names, it is not easy to block out time for production on Big Little Lies, and unfortunately, that might make Season 2 the last season of the show. In a new profile with Variety, Nicole Kidman said that although she and her costars would love to make a third season, she thinks that getting everyone back together could be difficult:\n\nI think it would be hard to get the whole group together. But we would love to do it.\n\nHBO\n\nAnother reason that Big Little Lies may not continue for much longer is the fact that it was only originally intended to run for one season. After fully telling the story of Liane Moriarty's Big Little Lies novel in Season 1, Moriarty penned a brand new continuation to her book once HBO announced it was picking up a second season.\n\nThe plot for the upcoming season is a big mystery for fans, but we do know it will most likely center on the group of women trying to keep quiet about the murder of Celeste Wright's abusive husband, Perry. Season 1 ended with Bonnie Carlson pushing Perry down a flight of stairs to his death, and the group of moms agreeing to keep the murder a secret to protect Bonnie. Although they seemed to manage to get the police off their scent, Meryl Streep will be playing Perry's mother, Mary Louise Wright, in Season 2, and her arrival in Monterey is sure to complicate matters.\n\nA bigger mystery still is when Season 2 of Big Little Lies will finally premiere. The new season filmed throughout this past summer, and is set to premiere sometime in 2019.",

Kesha released a new, female-empowerment anthem called Woman on Thursday, and sported a glittery gold outfit for the music video\n\nThe 30-year-old's new number enlists instrumental accompaniment from the Dap-Kings Horns, and boasts a funkier feel than her previous electro-pop sound.\n\nThe performer doesn't hold back in the chorus, boldly swearing while belting about how she's proud to be a female.\n\n'I'm a motherf--king woman, baby, alright/I don't need a man to be holding me too tight/I'm a motherf--king woman, baby, that's right/I'm just having fun with my ladies here tonight/I'm a motherf--ker,' she belts in the chorus.\n\nIndependent woman: In the song, the celeb sang about how she makes her own money, and doesn't need a man to buy her anything\n\nDown and dirty: Kesha had fun rolling around on the floor for the new visual\n\nRocking out: The 30-year-old channeled her inner rock star when she sang after collapsing to the ground\n\nIn the horn-centric single, the blonde sings about being an independent woman, and how she doesn't need a guy to 'buy [her] love.'\n\n'I buy my own things, I pay my own bills/These diamond rings, my automobiles/Everything I got, I bought it,' she sings.\n\n'Don't buy me a drink, I make my money/Don't touch my weave, don't call me \"honey\"/'Cause I run my sh-t, baby,' she continues.\n\nGorgeous in gold: The style icon sported an entirely-gold ensemble including a matching jumpsuit, cape, and shoes\n\nIn the fun-filled video, which was co-directed by Kesha and her brother Lagan, the pop star donned a glittery gold outfit from head to toe, clad in a form-fitting gold jumpsuit, matching shoes, and a sparkly cape.\n\nThe wild child danced, sang, and rolled around on the floor of Delaware's Oddity Bar while a band played behind her and shiny streamers dangled from the ceiling.\n\nShe also opened up about the exciting accomplishment to Rolling Stone.\n\n'It was one of those projects where I knew exactly what I wanted and it was just easier to do it ourselves than try to explain my vision to another director,' she told the publication.\n\nShe also penned a letter about the song's conception for the magazine's website, explaining why she was inspired to create Woman.\n\n'I just really f--king love being a woman and I wanted an anthem for anyone else who wants to yell about being self-sufficient and strong. (Yes, men, this song can be for you too.)'\n\nShe also recalled the exact moment she came up with the expletive-ridden chorus.\n\n'I was really feeling that conviction one particular day while I was stuck in traffic on my way to the studio and out of nowhere I felt the urge to scream, \"I'm a motherf--king woman.\" By the time I got the the studio, I was chanting \"I\u2019m a motherf--king woman,\"' she remembered.\n\nNew sound, same Kesha: The star threw back shots as she partied in the video\n\nIt's 5 o'clock somewhere... The clip was filmed at Delaware's Oddity Bar\n\nCool cameo: The visual also included Saundra Williams of the Dap-Kings Horns, who sang backing vocals on the new number\n\nThe musician also clarified that, while the sonic style of her upcoming album Rainbow is vastly different than her previous work, she's still the same crazy kid.\n\n'I love the music I have made before, but it was funny to me that I would go play huge EDM festivals and then I\u2019d go onto my tour bus and get out my record player and put on Iggy Pop, Rolling Stones, Beach Boys, T Rex, Dolly Parton, James Brown, Beatles, The Sweet; any of those records,' she explained.\n\n'They all couldn't be more different sonically from what I was doing, even though the same wild spirit was there,' she continued.\n\nShe certainly showed off her wild child side, throwing back shots in the video with Saundra Williams of the Dap-Kings Horns, who also provided background vocals on the track.\n\nParty time: Gold streamers hung from the ceiling as the artist performed in the clip\n\nCountry girl at heart: Kesha sported a deep red cowboy hat and a matching jacket in the video's intro\n\nAt one point in the song's second verse, Kesha breaks, and begins laughing through the line.\n\nShe admitted in the letter why the spontaneous giggles didn't get cut.\n\n'I wanted this song to capture that organic, raw, soulful sound and keep the imperfect moments in the recordings because I find the magic in the imperfections,' she said.\n\nEven though the song's theme is one of female empowerment, the artist actually co-wrote the anthem with two men, Drew Pearson and Stephen Wrabel.\n\nBut she doesn't believe penning the track with guys takes away from its meaningful message.\n\n'It reinforces how supportive men can be of women AND feminism. That day was one of the best writing sessions of my life. It was pure raw joy,' she wrote in the letter.\n\nThe big day: The songwriter posted on Instagram on Wednesday to announce Woman was coming\n\nBare and beautiful: Kesha posted another photo from her Rainbow album art, where she sports only body glitter and face paint\n\nOn Wednesday, Kesha took to Instagram to excitedly announce her new song was on the way.\n\nShe posted a shot of herself flipping her long locks while sporting a pale pink embroidered jacket.\n\n'WOMAN,' the caption simply read.\n\nShe also uploaded another image from her album art, standing completely naked aside from some body glitter and face paint, as the music video dropped on Thursday.\n\nComing back: Kesha released Woman exactly one week after dropping Praying, her first single in four years\n\nOvercoming the dark moments: In the Praying visual, the blonde smashed televisions that displayed disturbing messages portraying in society\n\nKeeping her head held high: Kesha rocks a rainbow dress while holding a giant flag as she walks along the beach\n\nThe new release comes exactly one week after Kesha made her valiant return to the music world.\n\nOn July 6, she dropped Praying, her first single in four years.\n\nThe inspiring anthem seems to be pretty obviously about the contentious legal battle the singer has had with her scandalized producer, Dr. Luke, as she sings about overcoming hardship and rising above it.\n\nRainbow is set to drop on August 11, 2017.",

Nothing about today\u2019s proceedings changes Mr. Weinstein\u2019s position,\u201d attorney Benjamin Brafman said in a statement after the arraignment. \u201cHe has entered a plea of not guilty and fully expects to be exonerated.\u201d\n\nStill, news that Weinstein is facing criminal charges prompted strong reactions from Hollywood figures, including some of his accusers.\n\n\u201cSending love to all my sisters today who stood up against a monster\u2026 so many emotions\u2026 I am proud of and grateful to you all,\u201d actress Mira Sorvino tweeted.\n\nSorvino told The New Yorker in October that Weinstein made unwanted sexual advances toward her when they worked on a project together in 1995.\n\nActress Anne Hathaway shared on her Instagram a statement from Time\u2019s Up, the entertainment industry-backed advocacy group and legal defense fund that emerged in the aftermath of the Weinstein scandal to support women in the workplace.\n\n\u201cToday a man whose actions were so egregious that they spawned a global reckoning has been taken into custody,\u201d the statement from the group said. \u201cHarvey Weinstein shattered the lives of an untold number of women. We stand with them and remain in solidarity with women everywhere who have faced unsafe and abusive workplaces. We look forward to seeing justice prevail.\u201d\n\nAnother one of Weinstein\u2019s accusers, Asia Argento, tweeted shortly after Weinstein turned himself in.\n\n\u201cThis is the only movie Harvey Weinstein will be remembered for #perpwalk,\u201d she wrote.\n\nActivist Tarana Burke, who started the #MeToo movement, released a statement to CNN on Friday.\n\n\u201cThis is not a moment to revel in how the mighty have fallen but instead in how the silenced have spoken up, stood together and survived,\u201d Burke said. \u201cWeinstein\u2019s arrest, for the women who have accused him and others like them around the world, I\u2019m sure feels like a moment of catharsis and it should serve as a cautionary tale for others like [Morgan] Freeman and every day people who toe the line between unacceptable and criminal behavior.\u201d\n\nComedian Kathy Griffin had a strongly worded reaction: \u201cRot in prison you piece of sh*t.\u201d\n\nActress Rosanna Arquette, who came forward with allegations of her own in a New York Times follow-up report, has not made an official statement, but replied to one internet commenter who told her in part, \u201cIf you gals would have spoke up their (sic) would not have been others.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow dare you,\u201d Arquette replied. \u201cWe all spoke up years ago and no one listened. Most were threatened to shut up.\u201d\n\nFormer actress Rose McGowan, one of the first women to publicly accuse Weinstein of assault, gave an interview to Megyn Kelly upon news of Weinstein\u2019s arrest, saying, \u201cI can say this, the man who pinned me down had handcuffs on him today.\u201d\n\nShe also tweeted, \u201cWe got you, Harvey Weinstein, we got you.\u201d",

The women of the show gathered on a special Los Angeles edition of \u201cWatch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen\u201d last night. The stars joined Cohen on stage at the Wiltern Theatre to answer some fan questions and things escalated quickly. The ladies did not hold back on their snarky comments toward not only one another but audience members.\n\nThrowing shade\n\nAccording to E! News, one fan asked the stars what their taglines for each other would be.\n\nCohen said that Lisa Vanderpump had a \u201cvery shady one\u201d for her fellow co-star and fremeny Lisa Rinna. Vanderpump admitted, \"Oh, I just said, \u2018Go back to selling dusters and diapers.\u201d This was an obvious reference to Lisa Rinna\u2019s clothing line on QVC and her once appearing in a Depend commercial.\n\nRinna, who is known on the show for not holding back was quick to reply, \"And guess what, honey? Guess what? Do you know how much I've made on those dusters and diapers? A lot more than your restaurants I'm sure.\" This was once again a very obvious reference to Vanderpump\u2019s many restaurants, which includes the very popular SUR (the home base of hit show \"Vanderpump Rules\").\n\nFans as well as friend and co-star Kyle Richards appeared shocked at the shade although they probably should not have been because Rinna and Vanderpump have a very rocky friendship history.\n\nEven more drama\n\nBut this was just the start of the night\u2019s shady comments. A fan asked Dorit Kemsley, \"which glass goes well with coke?\" This question was about a few incidents involving Kemsley. One being her distaste when she was given Rose wine in a champagne glass and then of course it hinted at the infamous implication that Rinna made inferring Kemsley was doing cocaine during a dinner party.\n\nA claim that Kemsley fiercely denied.\n\nKemsley, who, according to her co-stars and fans, was the \u201cpot stirrer\u201d of the season, had no problem clapping back, saying: \"I wouldn't know, sour patch.\" She then went on to insult the fact that the questioner wanted to set up her son with Cohen, adding, \"I wonder why your son's having trouble getting married.\"\n\nEven Cohen seemed shocked by the shade happening on his late night talk show. This \u201cWatch What Happens Live\u201d seems to be foreshadowing the drama of the upcoming \u201cReal Housewives of beverly hills\u201d reunion.\n\nBe sure to tune in to all the drama every Tuesday at 9PM on Bravo.",

        "content": "The Boston Free Speech rally on Saturday has raised fears last weekend's white supremacist march on Charlottesville \u2014 and the ensuing violence \u2014 will play out in the Massachusetts capital, too. Groups of counter-protesters have gathered under a Fight Supremacy demonstration, including Antifa members, Black Lives Matter activists, and anti-racists across the board. But what does Fight Supremacy want, and what are their goals of the counter-protest?\n\nWell, for starters, the Facebook page for the Fight Supremacy counter-protest has over 14,000 marked as attending. So, in this case, gathering a crowd isn't an issue. As for the protest's objective, organizers shared a handful of clear intentions on the page. Understandably, one of the main intentions is to combat any possible repeat of the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville by organizing a coalition to march against the hate groups. There can be safety, or at least, solidarity in greater numbers.\n\n\"As we have seen with the events in Charlottesville and around the country, white nationalists are emboldened by the current political administration and growing police state. Rallies and marches organized by white supremacists are more prevalent than in recent years, and\u2014as always\u2014it is the most marginalized who are left vulnerable,\" read the Fight Supremacy event page.\n\nIn case violence breaks, the Boston Mayor Marty Walsh made it clear he's prepared to shut down the Free Speech rally. \"If anything gets out of hand, we will shut it down,\u201d Walsh said at a news conference Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to respect their right to free speech. In return, they must respect our city.\"\n\nIn preparation, there are already 500 police officers deployed to keep the peace. Although, given the fact that police officers stood by while a 20-year-old black man was beaten by white supremacists last weekend, their presence means little to those who need protection the most.\n\nBy noon on Saturday, there were already thousands of Fight Supremacy protesters gathered, greatly outnumber the amount of white supremacists who showed up.\n\n\"Resistance takes many forms. One of those forms is counter-protest. Counter-protests send a message to white supremacists that their hateful rhetoric, physical violence, and fear mongering will not go uncontested. It's also a show of solidarity and an opportunity for allies to \"show up\" and wield their privilege,\" wrote the Fight Supremacy mission statement.\n\nRegardless of how the events continue to unfold throughout the remainder of Saturday, it appears that Fight Supremacy organizers have already successfully gathered thousands to counter white supremacists. And that's a feat for such short notice.",

        "content": "In the latest promo for The Bachelor season finale, Arie Luyendyk Jr. calls himself a \"monster,\" but the context of his comment is, erm, unclear. We all know the race car hobbyist royally screwed up last week, when he professed his love to both Becca K. and Lauren B.; that's a big no-no in Bachelor land, as Ben Higgins infamously taught us a few seasons ago. So perhaps Luyendyk feels like a monster for leading these two women\u2014who are both too good for him, by the way\u2014on for so long.\n\n\"I fell in love with two different women,\" Luyendyk says in the promo, suppressing his need to make that weird \"mmm\" noise with his lips. That quasi-confirms what his \"monster\" comment is about, but I think it's much deeper than him just shrugging between Becca K. and Lauren B. Remember in the Bachelor: Women Tell All special, when ex-contestant Caroline Lunny, holding back tears, told Luyendyk, \"I know what you did, and I don't know how you could do that?\" That was some \"Lauren Conrad screaming at Heidi Montag in the club\"\u2013level drama. Whatever she's referring to is probably exactly why Luyendyk called himself a monster in this promo. And it's also probably why ABC keeps hyping up the finale as something we've \"never seen before.\" What the hell did Luyendyk do? Did he buy his fianc\u00e9e a race car covered in Mountain Dew ads instead of an engagement ring or something?\n\nIf you believe Us Weekly, Luyendyk is a monster because he reportedly called off his engagement to the winner to date his runner-up, which is a pretty monstrous, profoundly shitty thing to do. Granted, it's just a rumor now, but, yikes, that'd be seriously insane if it were true. That's a lot of drama and tears over someone who isn't Peter Kraus.\n\nCheck out the teaser for yourself, below:\n\nTo be honest, I don't have to see this episode to know Luyendyk is a monster. His idea of a perfect date is eating loudly on top of a race car in Scottsdale, Arizona, he's killing The Bachelor's ratings, and he says the word amazing more than any person ever should. Whichever woman is single with spon-con deals by the end of this is actually the winner.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nArie Luyendyk Jr. Isn\u2019t \u2018The Bachelor\u2019\u2014He\u2019s Your Ex-Boyfriend",

Tonight Melania Trump was quite the dazzling figure as she hosted the annual White House Historical Association dinner alongside Donald Trump, according to the NY Daily News.\n\nIn the photos, which you can see below, Melania Trump shines brightly in a sparkly floor-length gown, which the fashion finders at the White House Fash Twitter account have identified as a piece from Monique Lhuillier\u2019s line.\n\nPer the website where it can be purchased, the shiny number comes with a jewel neckline and capelet back. It\u2019s also short-sleeved and comes in an A-line silhouette. A black \u201ccontrast velvet tie\u201d sits at the waist, acting as a belt. If you\u2019re looking to purchase the dress for yourself, the designer\u2019s website has it listed at a whopping $7,995 dollars.\n\nIt should be noted that Melania Trump\u2019s version of the dress seems to have been altered based on her personal preferences. For starters, the lining of Melania Trump\u2019s dress seems to have a sweetheart neckline, while a sheer, sequined overlay covers her exposed shoulders and decolletage. The dress on the website doesn\u2019t seem to expose the bust of the gown. The sleeves appear to be shorter as well.\n\nMelania Trump didn\u2019t veer too far away from her usual hair and makeup looks. It seems that the former model prefers to keep her coif simple, even as her outfits remain anything but.\n\nWhat do you think of Melania Trump\u2019s sparkly Monique Lhuillier gown?

The hangout, however, took place amongst other friends and Selena's then-boyfriend, The Weeknd, wasn't present, but he was apparently cool with her hanging out with Justin again.\n\nYesterday, however, fans noticed that The Weeknd (n\u00e9e Abel Tesfaye) began to unfollow some of Gomez's friends and family members on Instagram after news broke of her Sunday hangout with Bieber.\n\nThen today, it was reported that Tesfaye and Gomez had called it quits on thier relationship after ten months together. Sources with knowledge of their split cited the distance between the couple as the main reason for the breakup; not Bieber's involvement. (Tesfaye is currently on tour.)",

And mine keeps getting bigger,\" she wrote. \"I hope you all had a wonderful day with your families!\"\n\nIn April, Caitlyn celebrated her future daughter-in-law at her bridal shower at the Santa Anita Park racetrack in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Caitlyn and Linda both love Kaitlynn. They're so happy for Brody,\" a source tells PEOPLE. \"Brody and Kaitlynn are just trying to focus on the positive and who is there to support them.\"\n\nCaitlyn shared a photo from the bridal shower, writing how happy she was to attend.\n\n\"Went to my first bridal shower,\" Caitlyn captioned a photo of her and Carter, 29. \"I had so much fun! PS so much better than Bachelor parties!\"\n\n\"I'm so happy you were there!!!\" Carter commented on the post. \"It meant a lot to me!!\"",

After landing at LAX from New York\u2019s JFK on a Delta flight on Sept. 15, Kocher realized that he had grabbed the wrong garment bag.\n\nInstead of his own \u2014 containing a navy Calvin Klein tuxedo that he looked \u201cfresh as fuck in\u201d \u2014 Kocher was holding someone else\u2019s, so he posted a lengthy plea on Twitter to his 15,000 followers detailing the dire situation.\n\n\u201cWhoever has my bag is also going to the Emmys, because I have their bag and there\u2019s a suit and tuxedo in it. Repost this. The more people who see it the better.\u201d\n\nHis post got retweeted more than 4,000 times, eventually making its way to Matt Lappin, a producer on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. \u201cDUDE! I have your clothes! I had to wear your jacket last night, and you were right. I looked fresh as f-ck! How do we meet?\u201d Lappin wrote in his message to Kocher, shared by the latter on social media.\n\nThe two met up and swapped garment bags but not without this \u201cfun fact\u201d from Kocher about their situation: \u201cMatt works for Colbert and is nominated against us, so while this looks friendly, he is my dire enemy and I wish him ruin.\u201d\n\nHe was only kidding, but one Twitter user wasn\u2019t when he slammed Kocher\u2019s plea and likened it to \u201can overwritten SNL sketch\u201d that \u201cwas done to get some publicity for himself close to Emmy time.\u201d\n\nKocher and Lappin had the last laugh, though, reuniting on the Emmys red carpet outside the Microsoft Theater and posing for preshow photos. \u201cYou guys. YOU GUYS! Sometimes the internet is great,\u201d Kocher posted. \u201cThanks to everyone who gave attention to this instead of things that are actually important!\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for them, both went home empty-handed as the Emmy went to the writing staff on Last Week Tonight With John Oliver. Kocher declined a request for comment while Lappin could not be reached by THR.\n\n(For a hilarious recap of the entire garment bag fiasco, let Kocher walk you though here.)\n\nWe did it!

'Reverend Curry was right!'\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe Emmy-award winning star revealed she couldn't get enough of the Duchess of Sussex's personal touches on her big day at St George's Chapel in Windsor on 19 May, which included a sermon from Chicago-based pastor Bishop Michael Bruce Curry.\n\nDuring his impassioned speech about the enduring message of compassion, Curry honoured the duchess' American heritage, and quoted the late great Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n'We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love,' he told the guests. 'And when we discover that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world. Love is the only way.'\n\nGetty Images\n\nOpening up about the couple's nuptials in the August edition of O, The Oprah Magazine, the star also recalled how shocked she was to be overcome with so much emotion during the nuptials.\n\n'I was unprepared for the depth of emotion I felt stepping onto the grounds of Windsor Castle,' Oprah wrote in the upcoming issue. 'It literally took my breath away. I exclaimed out loud to no one in particular: \"Whoa! This right here is a whole 'nother level!\"'\n\n'And I thought immediately of the history, the legacy, the astounding moment Meghan Markle was stepping into. And what it would take to be prepared for such a moment,' she added. 'The life she was leaving behind and the new world to which she was rising\u2014all part of a destiny she helped design.'\n\nThe A Wrinkle In Time star also let slip about how smitten the bride and groom looked during the celebration.\n\n'We all want to feel as radiant, joyful, and alive as Meghan looked on her way down the aisle to meet Harry. Both of them were glowing with happiness,' she continued.\n\nGetty Images\n\n'I can't wait to see the goodness that will come from their union. Goodness that I know for sure will help change the way the world thinks about what is possible, even more than it already has.'\n\nWinfrey had previously disclosed that two days before the royal wedding, she had to change her cream dress she commissioned from Stella McCartney over fears that it looked too white.\n\nThanking Stella McCartney and her team for working round the clock to remake it in pale pink, the media mogul shared a photo of her new dress on Instagram along with the caption: 'Thank you @stellamccartney!'\n\n'Realised Friday morning the beige dress I was planning to wear to Royal ceremony would photograph too \"white\" for a wedding.Her team did this overnite.

OMG was this an extraordinary day.'\n\nMeanwhile, in the run up to the wedding, Meghan's mother Doria Ragland visited Winfrey's Santa Barbara home where they enjoyed yoga and ate kumquats.

This kind of language is often used to grab attention and make the story sound more exciting.\n2. There are multiple sources mentioned: a single source from Star magazine, which could be a tabloid publication known for its sensationalized stories. Without additional corroboration from other reputable sources, this one source is not enough to establish credibility.\n3. The message involves several celebrities, including Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston, George Clooney, and Justin Theroux. This makes it more likely that the story is fabricated or exaggerated, as there are many people involved who would have to be aware of the relationship's status and would likely comment on it if it were true.\n4. The message also involves a plot twist: Brad Pitt was supposedly shunned by George Clooney after his marriage to Angelina Jolie imploded. This seems like an unusual detail that might be added to make the story more interesting.\n\nConsidering these factors, I think it's likely that this message is false or at least heavily exaggerated.

She tells ET that before Jenna becomes a Chmerkovskiy, she should learn the following things:\n\n1. \"Say 'ichka' at the end of every word to make it cute. Like, babe-ichka, Peta-ichka, Maks-ichka. You do it with baby words, too.\"\n\n2. \"Learn how to make Russian salads. Key.\"\n\n3. \"And always have fruit in the fridge. A stocked fridge.\"\n\nAs for Maks and Peta, they are very much looking forward to Val and Jenna's bachelor and bachelorette parties, as the two never had their own before they tied the knot last July.\n\n\"We might go to Disneyland,\" teased Maks, who also told us that Val has yet to officially ask him to be best man. \"You know, mix it up a little bit!\"\n\n\"Maybe we should do a joint one,\" added Peta. \"Maybe Vegas?\"\n\nYes, please!\n\nET also spoke with Val at the event, who told us the two have finally locked down a wedding month.

However, the rumor mill died down a little when Kelly went on to host her show alone, and Michael landed Good Morning America and despite the passive aggressive interviews that Kelly gave since Michael\u2019s departure (if we can call it that), things between the former co-hosts seemed to have died down a little.\n\nHowever, Michael Strahan\u2019s new game show \u2018The $100,000 Pyramid\u2019 has been making waves recently, both with ratings and guest stars. ABC has confirmed that stars like Rachael Ray, Tom Bergeron, Aaron Rodgers, and Cam Newton will all be appearing on the second season of \u2018The $100,000 Pyramid\u2019 when it returns in June.\n\nThe show has been gaining steam on the game show circuit, and as its been amassing a large fan base and impressive ratings, Kelly Ripa has allegedly felt even more slighted than she did before.\n\nShe was reportedly already jealous of the fact that Michael\u2019s star was rising so quickly, and the fallout from their final days together on the show certainly didn\u2019t help. Plus, the fact that he was immediately inundated with offers from other shows and higher rated shows, at that, reportedly made her seethe more, even though she had to put on a confident facade for the show.\n\nBut alas, there\u2019s only so long that she can keep faking the fact that she doesn\u2019t care about Michael\u2019s success off the show, especially as she still struggles to find longer term co-hosts who\u2019ll put up with her alleged attitude problems and diva behavior.\n\nWhat do you guys think about Kelly Ripa\u2019s jealousy over Michael Strahan\u2019s new career successes? Do you think she\u2019s still bitter over her former co-star\u2019s ratings bonanza, or has she moved on?

(A rep for Leakes had no comment.)\n\n\u201cShe put #KKK on the Instagram post. I\u2019ve hired legal counsel at this point. It\u2019s just that bad,\u201d she told Larry King on Larry King Now Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate. In this day and age, people are dying over racism,\u201d said Zolciak-Biermann, who hasn\u2019t seen Leakes since the feud ignited. \u201cI\u2019m on a show with all African-American women and I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s ever been on the show that\u2019s Caucasian, so it\u2019s the card that sometimes they play and it\u2019s gross. And I won\u2019t allow it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI probably won\u2019t shoot with her again,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t take this lightly. It\u2019s one thing like I said to kind of banter back and forth and have an opinion,\u201d Zolciak-Biermann, 39, told E!\u2019s Daily Pop on Tuesday. \u201cThis is far beyond just having an opinion.\u201d\n\nThe reality star\u2019s decision to hire legal advisors comes on the heels of a public feud that involves herself, her 20-year-old daughter Brielle Biermann and Leakes.\n\nOn Thursday, Leakes, 49, slammed Brielle over claims of \u201cprejudice\u201d after the mother-daughter pair visited Leakes\u2019 home and allegedly found cockroaches. Leakes shared her response to an old video that showed Brielle in her bathroom with what appeared to be black bugs.\n\nIn addition, Leakes shared the recently resurfaced video of Brielle on her own Instagram account.\n\n\u201c@briellebiermann We don\u2019t have roaches! If you found 1, u brought it with u or it fell outta yo funky p\u2014-! Please know I will get You all the way together when you start f\u2014ing with me and mine!\u201d Leakes wrote in the comments section.\n\n\u201cGo somewhere and let the air outta those fake lips, fake titties and fake ass because you will never be @kylejenner Yo trashy mama should have taught you better! My home is Brand New but you guys were so jealous of it, you couldn\u2019t even give a compliment. You had to stoop so low and be so disgusting #racisttrash,\u201d she concluded.\n\nWATCH: NeNe Leakes Slams Kim Zolciak-Bierman Over Daughter\u2019s Snapchat Video, Calls RHOA Costar \u2018Racist\u2019\n\nAlso on Thursday, Brielle responded in the comment section of her own Instagram post after a follower accused her of calling Leakes a \u201cblack roach.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not calling BLACK people roaches! I found a roach in NENEs home! not calling her a roach dumb f\u2014. doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re black, white, hispanic, asian etc you can still have roaches in ur house if u don\u2019t f\u2014ing clean ur s\u2014!!! #callorkinpls,\u201d the eldest Biermann child wrote.\n\nThen, Leakes responded in the comments of a separate Instagram account, calling the Biermann duo \u201cracists.\u201d\n\n\u201cKim & her daughter oops whole family are racists! What her daughter did at my home, (which she nor kim were invited to so be clear abt that as well) was pure disgusting, racist, learned behavior etc,\u201d Leakes wrote, adding, \u201cchildren are NOT off limits when you allow your child to talk to adults any kind of way, post disrespectful things on social media and so on. Kim is a calculating bio polar racist with a horrible mouth, who uses black folks for her come up.\u201d\n\nZolciak-Biermann told her side of the story to defend Brielle, saying RHOA fans and viewers will soon see the bug incident play out on the upcoming season.\n\n\u201cFirst off that video is a combination of 2 videos! I COMBINED THEM! Brielle posted the first video on snap unaware of the large bug in front of her when she was kneeling down .. until her DM\u2019s blew up! She removed the video immediately!! I was filming as an INVITED guest at @neneleakes for RHOA!! Brielle was invited as well!\u201d Zolciak-Biermann wrote on Instagram.\n\n\u201cBrielle went to the bathroom and saw several bugs and had sent ME the video on snap and NO ONE ELSE!!! We ARE filming a show, remember that, (RHOA) and Nene released this video herself! No one has EVER seen this video but RHOA! Nobody would have ever seen this video! Nene has said and done some things that are absolutely disgusting, however I will take the high road as you will see it on the show soon enough, but you WILL NOT make it seem as though my daughter did ANYTHING wrong! She never posted this video nor would she! As you see here I myself was not willing to send the video just for ratings for RHOA. END OF STORY,\u201d Zolciak-Biermann concluded.\n\nIn a follow-up post, Zolciak-Biermann wrote a lengthy statement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so sad and offensive that someone can stoop so low as to call someone a racist just because they are mad. Everyone in my life knows that I am far from racist and unfortunately NeNe Leaks has tried for the last 10 years to paint that picture because that\u2019s her last resort. (It\u2019s convenient that I\u2019m not racist when we are getting along.),\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIn a day and age where racism is very much alive and people are actually dying because of real racists, it\u2019s heartbreaking that NeNe would cry wolf like this only because she\u2019s upset. I think everyone including Nene needs to spend some time uplifting people insted of tearing them down. Nene should be embracing love instead of making up lies. There is absolutely no credibility to anything that she has said. I will NOT stand for these slanderous comments!\u201d\n\nWATCH: NeNe Leakes Returning to \u2018Real Housewives of Atlanta\u2019 for Season 10!\n\nLater, Leakes responded to Zolciak-Biermann\u2019s post with another statement of her own.\n\n\u201cKim Zolciak is the one that sent the video to Cynthia, Sheree, Marlo, Porsha and Kandi while we were filming in Spain. Now she has the nerve to make a pitty post! No one from Kim\u2019s household was invited to my white party. Kim came as Sheree\u2019s plus 1. She is a huge lier,\u201d Leakes wrote.\n\n\u201cAll this season I have done nothing but try an be kind to her even when she said disrespectful things to me and broke glasses in my home. I STILL continue to be kind to her but this calculated video that was shot in my home during a time when we had no problems shows how low she will really go! Then she turns around an try to get the fans on her side of this s\u2014 #trash.\u201d\n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta premieres Nov. 5 (8 p.m. ET) on Bravo.",

Consequentially, it became a central focus of the series since its third season, and was carried through each subsequent season. Brescia and Patridge met while he was working as a hairdresser for the band Maroon 5.[2]\n\nHe is the vocalist, guitarist and percussionist for the Austin, Texas-based band, BobbyrocK[3]\n\nBiography [ edit ]\n\nIn 2006, MTV developed the reality television series The Hills as the spin-off of Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County. It originally chronicled the lives of Lauren Conrad, who appeared on its predecessor, her housemate Heidi Montag, and friends Audrina Patridge and Whitney Port.[4]\n\nBrescia launched a line of vegan and non-toxic hair care and styling products in the summer of 2012 called BRUSH by Justin Bobby Brescia. The products were featured on Amazon and designed for professional use.[5] Brescia highlighted his product line in his professional hair salons.\n\nAt the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, MTV announced a reboot of The Hills entitled The Hills: New Beginnings, slated to premiere in 2019. Brescia was announced as part of the cast of the new series.[6][7][8] In 2021, Brescia made his acting debut in the film The Chimera Effect, currently in post-production, and contributed music to the film Room 9.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nJustin Brescia at IMDb",

It\u2019s not fun. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy.

        "content": "Last season, Dr. Jackie was a mature woman who survived cancer and sought to be a role model for African-American women. Dr. Simone was a doctor who liked to drink, hated exercise and loved her family. Mariah and her Black-adeshi family were at the center of most fights and Quad tried to avoid having sex with her nerdy husband. Oh, and Toya made Kelly Bundy look like a Pulitzer prize winner. Kari was there but she\u2019s undergoing a very personal struggle with her lips and couldn\u2019t be a part of this season.\n\nQuad is back and looking semi-clownish. Her hair is orange, her lips are red and her eyeshadow looks like something out of Face Maker circa 1983. It could be the fact that I\u2019m watching this on a 13 inch TV but all of this color is making my soul hurt. Anyway, she\u2019s shopping at her friend\u2019s store and he brings up the pressure for her to have a child. Okay, is this scene even in English? Quad and Reco sound like the result of James Brown possessing their bodies \u2013 if he was resurrected as a gay Southern man. I think the moral of the story is that Quad doesn\u2019t want to have babies yet but let\u2019s get down to the real story. Reco asked Mariah to pose for his magazine but she said she was busy. He told her he wanted to use Quad but Mariah felt it wasn\u2019t right to use someone else in her circle. Quad cries because her BFF is a selfish moron. I can\u2019t believe she was really crying over this so I choose to believe that there\u2019s more to this story. Maybe Mariah tried to show a family vacation slideshow on Quad\u2019s forehead. I don\u2019t know.\n\nDr. Jackie and Dr. Simone meet and discuss fun facts. For instance, some women forget to remove their IUD for decades and it\u2019s up to these brave souls to remove it. That was just the appetizer for the really fun stuff. Dr. Jackie talks about her husband\u2019s regret over not having a son. The first year of her marriage was when she went through her first bout with cancer. She also had a miscarriage so she wants to discuss using donor eggs with his sperm so he can have a child. Dr. Simone warns her not to do it because she\u2019s busy and she\u2019ll have to give stuff up in order to have a child. The conversation ends abruptly when Dr. Simone has to take off to push the eject button on a patient\u2019s uterus.\n\nMariah ruins her daughter\u2019s self-esteem during a family photo shoot when she tells her that she doesn\u2019t know how to give face and takes her place in the family photo. I see a Lauren Manzo in the making. I don\u2019t know what the Black-adeshi equivalent of provolone and egg salad is but order up a 30 year supply. Stat. Mariah\u2019s family, including her infamous mother, is there for dinner and Mariah asks her nephew Ian about being bullied at school. Mariah\u2019s advice to him is to beat up the girl who\u2019s been hitting him. More specifically, \u201chit it and quit it!\u201d First of all, the girl probably likes him and secondly, has Mariah not heard of school shootings and suicide? Kids are over the top these days. The last thing they need is permission to act out on whatever impulse they have. Third, \u201chit it and quit it\u201d definitely refers to sex. Perhaps she wants him to continue the reality tradition and be a star on MTV\u2019s Teen Dad: Reality Offspring. Then again this is Mariah. She\u2019d probably love for the kid to have a full meltdown so he can\u2019t overshadow her own kids.\n\nMariah says that she and Quad don\u2019t speak anymore and her sister says that Mariah created Quad. Actually, Suzuki invented quads. Mariah says that Rico Chapple, the dress shop man, got in Quad\u2019s ear about Mariah being jealous of her. Mariah\u2019s mother must\u2019ve read her hate mail last season because she\u2019s dressed like she\u2019s going to an inauguration and she\u2019s got a Hilary Clinton weave. Mariah\u2019s mom is disappointed in Quad so you know what that means. Quad\u2019s getting a beat down with a purse.\n\nDr. Simone gets home late from work. She missed her kid\u2019s game because a patient was in labor. Her husband, Cecil, was able to cover parental duties. She feels like she\u2019s trying to juggle lots of balls and based on her husband\u2019s facial expression, there\u2019s definitely a couple of blue balls in the house. Dr. Simone switched to a new billing system and she was prepared for a 3 month pay delay but not the 6 month one that she\u2019s going through. I love a doctor who can admit she\u2019s broke right now and can call herself a bitch in a loving way. I should have gone to medical school. I\u2019m always calling myself names and avoiding calls from collections.\n\nQuad is making breakfast for her husband, Greg. He\u2019s surprised and she makes the point that she can do this now that she doesn\u2019t work. She\u2019s brilliant! Quit work, do one menial task and justify leeching for as long as possible. Momma Joyce from RHOA would be relieved to know that Kandi\u2019s not the only \u2018victim\u2019. I love that she greets her husband politely but says good morning to her dogs like they got a medical degree and give her an eyeshadow allowance. Plus, her husband speaks in a higher pitch than her dogs bark and he doesn\u2019t need to be walked. He might need to be neutered though. She would give him sexy time but he farts in his sleep. I don\u2019t know why we need to hear about this but it makes me understand my perpetual loneliness. Dr. Gregory brings up the baby subject and fails to get her in the mood by basically saying that she\u2019s old. He tells her that she\u2019s on the back-end of thirty and she needs to get started. She laughs it off, says she\u2019s just starting her thirties and secretly pours laxative into his pancake batter.\n\nToya is a stay at home mom. Bravo basically spends 12 seconds catching up on her life of barely taking care of her kids and then has her go over to her dentist and friend\u2019s house. Dr. Heavenly says that Toya isn\u2019t the sharpest knife in the drawer but she likes her spirit\u2026and role on a TV show. Dr. Heavenly is having a soiree for Atlanta\u2019s medial elite and hopes that everyone is on their best behavior. She questions the behavior of Drs. Jackie and Simone at Toya\u2019s sickle cell event. Dr. Jackie offended a plus-sized pageant winner and Dr. Simone was dancing on Toya\u2019s husband. It sounds to me like the two of them went to reality TV school over the hiatus.\n\nDr. Simone borrows a purse from Dr. Jackie for the party and says she\u2019s putting nothing in it.

Angie loves Target. It\u2019s one of her favorite stores, and it\u2019s where she buys lots of Christmas gifts. Walking around with her shopping cart makes her feel happy.\u201d\n\nGossip Cop stressed that there\u2019s no truth to such claims, and reiterated that it all started after Radar Online published a story about Jolie struggling with her finances. The tabloid claimed that Jolie has opted to buy discounted items at Target because of her money problems.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s also no truth to such rumors because the actress\u2019 net worth is roughly around $160 million. She has just completed a series of successful projects, namely, \u201cFirst They Killed My Father\u201d and \u201cThe Breadwinner,\u201d which generated huge sums of money.\n\nMeanwhile, Jolie was also spotted at Target with her two kids, Shiloh, and Vivienne in August. The trio wanted to buy food at the store, but immediately left Target after they learned that it was no longer available.\n\nGossip Cop also stressed the fact that there\u2019s no truth to the claims made by the sister sites because even their statements contradicted each other. Last week, Radar Online quoted their source, \u201cWalking around with her shopping cart makes her feel normal again.\u201d\n\nNational Enquirer, on the other hand, wrote, \u201cWalking around with her shopping cart makes her feel happy.\u201d\n\nBut regardless of where Jolie wants to shop, the most important thing is that she gets to spend time with her six children. The single mom has joint custody of her kids with Brad Pitt. The actor only has visitation rights to see their children, but all six of them are living with Jolie under one roof.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images/Dia Dipasupil",

Making history as the first gay film to be financed by a major studio (that\u2019s 20th Century Fox), it proves that in 2018, you don\u2019t have to be gay to love a gay love story.\n\nThe film centres on Simon Speirs (played by the comely, corn-fed Nick Robinson), a senior in high school with a doting family, a crew of close-knit friends, and one \u201chuge-ass secret\u201d \u2013 no one knows that he\u2019s gay. Simon is the chauffeur and confidante among his family and friends, navigating life with a knowing, Ferris Bueller-like serenity that perhaps college is the time for his coming out.\n\nHowever, he soon comes to a crossroads when he reads an anonymous confession by a fellow gay student on his school\u2019s message board. Making a bold move for the first time in his life, Simon tells his huge-ass secret to the other anonymous student, beginning an intimate email exchange between two strangers who feel like they could be each other\u2019s soulmates. Both express their fear and desire of coming out as they navigate their regular lives at high school, falling for each other in the process \u00e0 la You\u2019ve Got Mail.\n\nAn unexpected chain of events, including an elaborate manipulation of many other students\u2019 attractions for each other (it feels like a Shakespearean comedy of errors by way of The CW), eventually forces Simon to come out against his will, as he learns that honesty is the only way to earn his climatic first kiss on a Ferris wheel.\n\nSociety has waited a long time for a film like Love, Simon and there is much to be applauded in Berlanti\u2019s feature, including its self-aware humour, relevant social commentary, and wonderful supporting cast (especially the members of the faculty, played by Tony Hale and Insecure\u2019s Natasha Rothwell, who nearly steals the movie as a frustrated drama teacher directing a horrible production of Cabaret). It is an extremely entertaining and fairly woke movie for anyone who wants to understand the complexities of coming out, and will be an incredible resource for families of gay teenagers.\n\nBut while Love, Simon affords nearly every other supporting role deep and unique characterization, its blandly likable protagonist can only function as a Trojan horse to usher in queer empathy on screen. Sadly, Simon himself has no distinguishing characteristics outside of his own gay-ness, including any interests or opinions that could possibly offend or threaten his extremely important loveability. Finely calculated to appeal to as many moviegoers as possible, Robinson\u2019s queer kabuki act is all self-effacing middle-aged screenwriter jokes, pop-culture references, zip-up hoodies, and Justin Bieber puppy dog eyes. He rarely gets to make a bad or selfish choice and has zero flaws, except for perhaps being too understanding, and too adorable. And this feels extremely unfortunate when the need for LGBTQ teenagers to see themselves on screen has never been more crucial.\n\nConfessing your feelings and being honest about what you desire is one of the most vulnerable and hardest things to do, especially when you\u2019re young enough to have zero tools (but thankfully, a lot of pornography) at your disposal. It\u2019s fantastic that a whole new generation now has Love, Simon in the canon of queer cinema. As a consumer, it is simply your responsibility to see it, just so that many more Love, Simons can be made. There are worse things to spend your money on than this adorable teen gay comedy whose worst quality is its boring straight man.",

        "content": "CBS announced its new schedule Wednesday morning with some surprising news: Murphy Brown will make its grand return in the fall, earlier than some originally anticipated. It will also come with an unexpected twist: instead of running a newsmagazine, as she did in the original series, Candice Bergen\u2019s title heroine will now anchor a morning news show\u2014and her son, Avery, will be her top competitor\u2014at a conservative network.\n\nBergen and the cast celebrated the comedy\u2019s revival on stage Wednesday at CBS\u2019s Upfront presentation at Carnegie Hall. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to hear so many Americans actually cheering a bunch of journalists,\u201d Bergen said as she took the stage with her co-stars. \u201cWe want to stay really topical, which is why we didn\u2019t shoot a pilot. If we had, we\u2019d already be a dozen major headlines and several Stormies out of date. . . The world of cable news is fast-paced and populated with all kinds of characters\u2014from the Hannitys of the world to, well, actual journalists. Like Murphy Brown, the competition is fierce.\u201d During his own monologue after the cast left the stage, CBS\u2019s star late-night host, Stephen Colbert, offered a gently snarky take: \u201cIn addition to the big hit MacGyver, this fall CBS will have the reboot of Magnum P.I. and, as you saw, Murphy Brown\u2014guaranteeing that we will be the No. 1 network in 2018 and 1988.\u201d\n\nPer The Hollywood Reporter, the former staff of the newsmagazine FYI is now running a morning show on cable, titled Murphy in the Morning. According to New York Times TV reporter John Koblin, Corky Sherwood (Faith Ford) will co-host with Murphy, while Miles Silverberg (Grant Shaud) will produce the program. CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl confirmed to reporters that the dynamic between Murphy and her son\u2019s programs will be comparable to the one that exists between Morning Joe and Fox & Friends.\n\nAvery\u2019s presence on a conservative news show is a little ironic\u2014not just in the world of the series, but also in the real world; the original show\u2019s most memorable moment came when it responded directly to a real-world criticism from Dan Quayle over Murphy\u2019s decision to have her child out of wedlock. Still, the move could allow Murphy Brown to tackle some of the modern political issues that ABC\u2019s revived Roseanne has played with\u2014perhaps in a more organic way. Since Avery was a child when the original Murphy Brown first wrapped, his political leanings are, more or less, a blank slate. By making him a conservative, Murphy Brown will be able to examine the same fraught family dynamics that viewers have seen in Roseanne\u2014without re-writing any of the original series\u2019s history or changing characters into unrecognizable versions of their former selves.\n\nThe revived Murphy Brown is set to air on Thursdays at 9:30 P.M., in a comedy lineup that begins with Big Bang Theory, then moves on to Young Sheldon and Mom.\n\nOne thing CBS is certainly hoping to imitate? Roseanne\u2019s record ratings. When asked if the ABC comedy had raised his own network\u2019s ratings\u2019 hopes for Murphy Brown, Kahl stopped short of claiming to expect the same earth-shattering success. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely hopeful,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019d love to get Roseanne numbers. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to get Rosanne numbers.\u201d It\u2019s smart not to count on such monumental ratings, but it\u2019s safe to say CBS is sure hoping for them.",

I appreciate your engagement, your support and, mostly, your reciprocated snark.\n\nI am absolutely certain Katy Primosch will do a wonderful job every week moving forward. I am excited to follow along.\n\nI am also always available anywhere on social media @abbydraper to discuss all things \u201cBachelor.\u201d Or Tim Riggins.\n\nThank you, guys, for the fun. Don\u2019t be a stranger. Now, back to your regularly scheduled recap:\n\nHi, my name is Katy, and I\u2019m a Bachelor-holic. I\u2019ll be taking the reins from the infamous Abby Draper for your \u201cBachelor\u201d franchise recaps, and while I couldn\u2019t possibly fill her shoes, I\u2019ll fill my wine glass and hope for the best.\n\nWelcome to Season 4 of \u201cBachelor in Paradise.\u201d After seeing the trailer for this season during last week\u2019s \u201cBachelorette\u201d finale, I\u2019m left wondering how much ABC paid the standards department to look the other way on this season\u2019s content. It is entirely possible that Chris Harrison\u2019s ubiquitous promise of \u201cthe most dramatic season ever\u201d may finally ring true.\n\nWe open to shots of an empty resort with dramatic music and audio clips of news stories about the \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d production shutdown in the background. Chris Harrison strolls in and sounds downright cheerful, which is weird, because he\u2019s here to give background about the \u201caccusations and allegations\u201d of potential sexual misconduct that led to a decision to halt production 2 1/2 days into filming. Chris explains that before addressing what happened, the show will recap what happened before production halted, and we begin the episode.\n\nTHE ENTRANCES\n\nRaven, the dark-haired dark horse from Nick\u2019s season, is the first to enter. She drops every Bachelor Nation platitude in her first breath, and she\u2019s looking for a Jade and Tanner love story, but a Carly and Evan one would be OK too. Ouch.\n\nDeanie-baby is next, and he might be wearing silk boxers instead of a swim suit.\n\nNext up is Kristina, the fan-favorite Russian beauty who is now a blonde. She says it feels like a 2-on-1 date, and there must be another boy coming next \u2026 which of course means another girl will arrive.\n\nDanielle M. enters and immediately ends every sentence with a comment about how hot Dean is.\n\nBen Z. joins the crew with an eye for Raven. He pulls her aside and launches in to a monologue about his dog and possibly his entire pet ownership history. He says his dog, Zeus, needs a dog mom, and even I, a crazy dog lady, am weirded out.\n\nFinally, we get a romantic embrace \u2014 between Dean and new-arrival Iggy.\n\nFormer Disney princess Jasmine arrives and is looking forward to meeting the guys from Rachel\u2019s season, in particular.\n\nJack Stone, who everyone agrees is not just Jack but Jack Stone, appears and goes on the record that he is NOT a serial killer as everyone thought during Rachel\u2019s season.\n\nThere\u2019s a gap in my notes here, because Alexis walks up the beach path in her shark suit, and I\u2019m laughing hysterically and screaming with joy. She is an American treasure.\n\nThere\u2019s a break in the arrivals for everyone to grab a drink and begin gossiping. The ladies gather to discuss Demario and whether he really had a girlfriend while on Rachel\u2019s season. They appear to be very anti-Demario, and say they hope he won\u2019t show up, so of course \u2026 he shows up. Who would have thought?\n\nDemario wants to set everything straight, but he doesn\u2019t really answer Chris Harrison\u2019s questions, and he still refers to the events of last season as \u201chappening to him.\u201d He sees that Raven is clearly the pack leader and attempts to get to her to plead his case and show her he\u2019s in paradise for the right reasons. Raven is conciliatory, but then the show cuts to an interview of her that shows she\u2019s not quite buying it.\n\nAfter the heart-to-heart, Derek sneaks in and has to introduce himself as the one who cried on JoJo\u2019s season, because no one saw him come in and no one knows who he is.\n\nHis frenemy and Chief Narrator, Alex, joins the cast. He\u2019s excited to see his buddy Derek, who is simultaneously suggesting that Alex might be overcompensating for something.\n\nCorinne tells Chris Harrison she\u2019s \u201cMaking Paradise Corinne Again,\u201d and I\u2019m not sure how that works, but I\u2019m quickly distracted by Corinne\u2019s stellar language skills. She learned how to say \u201cnap,\u201d \u201ccheesy pasta,\u201d and \u201cchampagne\u201d in Spanish. She\u2019s in charge and is ready to have a siesta fiesta.\n\n\u201cCamel girl,\u201d aka Lacey, joins the group, and Iggy is already interested. It seems to be reciprocated, but the dream is short-lived because, unfortunately, Lacey has to leave immediately to attend to a death in the family at home.\n\nVinny and Diggy make nondescript entrances and remain boring for the rest of the episode.\n\nWhile we wait for the remainder of the cast, we are treated to flirtation and a back massage between Demario and Corinne, and another cute chat between Dean and Kristina.\n\nAlex delivers some snark about guys who rely on gimmicks, just as Matt the penguin, and St. Nick arrive in their respective costumes. Not to be out-snarked, Matt says Nick\u2019s Santa Claus beard is a cop-out and he should have gone for a full costume.\n\nImmediately, Nick confesses that he\u2019s in paradise specifically to meet Jasmine and they have the first kiss of the day after a dare.\n\n\u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d veteran Amanda is back for another shot at love. Her engagement to World\u2019s Worst Dude Josh Murray didn\u2019t work out \u201cbecause he\u2019s a sweaty person.\u201d She returns her Neil Lane engagement ring to Chris Harrison and (in my favorite moment of the night) he takes a sniff and says the ring smells like pizza.",

        "content": "\u201cThere are things the cast does not want to talk about, like Lauren and the sex tape. As producers, for us the challenge is getting access to what we know is the real story. Lauren would forever say, \u2018I\u2019m not mentioning Heidi\u2019s name,\u2019 or, \u2018I\u2019m not doing the show if she\u2019s on the show.\u2019 We were so sympathetic to that, but at the same time, you had Heidi wanting to make up with Lauren, still wanting to be a part of the show. And [you had] the sex tape rumors that Lauren didn\u2019t want to talk about, yet that was a betrayal that was so important and such a big elephant in the room that we just had to work with Lauren and say, \u2018Alright, so what are we going to do? We are going to have to access this somehow.\u2019 It\u2019s always a discussion\u2026 Lauren didn\u2019t want to confront Heidi. That was a catch-the-drama moment. As reality TV producers, we are hoping these two [will] meet up, you know? We were lucky enough to be there at the nightclub where we thought Heidi and Spencer might show up. We knew Lauren was there, and I think we knew they might show up.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into the specifics of [the sex tape rumors] just because that\u2019s their story, but from what we got on tape, it all just kind of came to a head at that nightclub. We were at Les Deux, [and] Heidi ended up showing up with Spencer, and [Lauren and Heidi] got into it outside. We weren\u2019t even aware that they were [fighting]. I mean, you can see at the beginning of that scene that we\u2019re scrambling to get our cameras there. There\u2019s even a shot of cameras, which we go to great lengths to avoid, but because it was happening in real time and it really went down, it erupted and happened so quickly that we just hustled to get it.\u201d Justin Bobby Brescia is the anti Spencer Pratt on The Hills. He\u2019s still a shitty reality TV boyfriend (please refer to the times Audrina caught him making out with other women while she was at the same club), but he has this seductive power that makes it easy to see why Audrina returns to him time after time. Justin Bobby speaks in ridiculous platitudes, like \u201cTruth and time tells all,\u201d which now sound like everything spewed on The Bachelor, but back then were unique in their somehow grounded inanity. It\u2019s hard to believe that he isn\u2019t putting on an act for cameras or behaving a certain way due to producer intervention. Both DiVello and Travis insist that it didn\u2019t take any special editing to depict Justin Bobby\u2019s essence to audiences, nor did much of his footage wind up on the cutting room floor.\u201cWe knew Audrina was dating Justin Bobby. All of season 2, we were thinking, \u2018Oh my gosh, Audrina has no story. All she does is go on dates with these guys, these funny characters.\u2019 But then we knew she had this boyfriend, and we weren\u2019t getting access to this story line. [We said to her], \u2018We know this is happening. We know you\u2019re dating this guy.\u2019 It took a lot of work, and I think it was [producer] Sara Mast, who came on in season 3; she was able to get Justin to trust us.\u201d\u201cJustin\u2019s such a genuinely nice person off camera to our crew and to all of us. He never gave us a problem. He was always very polite and thankful\u2026 I think Justin was a surprise each week, because he was like, \u2018I\u2019m starting to look like such an ass on the show. Can you not make me look so bad?\u2019 We weren\u2019t doing any of it. We kept explaining to him, \u2018You\u2019re doing this all to yourself. You\u2019re just seeing this on camera, but this is how you are.\u2019 I think he was such a great character, and he was such a natural on camera.\u201d\u201cIn Audrina and Justin\u2019s case, that was the relationship [in which] he was the bad [guy] who was really charming. She was always trying to break up with him or get away from him and his seductive power. Every time she would want to do it, if she broke up with him off camera, we would want her to at least have a conversation with him on camera so we could see that process, and inevitably they would get back together. So that turned out to be a long, drawn-out story line. What\u2019s interesting, too, [is that] you do a lot of shooting with cast members, and then some of the best stuff makes the cut, but with Justin, he was so unwilling to shoot. It was very hard. He would give us so little of his time, and I think that there aren\u2019t any shoots we did with Justin Bobby that didn\u2019t make it to air. I think every single scene we shot with him is on television.\u201d Lauren Conrad\u2019s mascara tears during her fight with Audrina in season 4 have become the GIF that keeps on GIF-fing from The Hills. In 2013, Conrad told Cosmopolitan that producers had slowed down her single tear to make it even more dramatic, and that, \u201cWhoops,\u201d she wasn\u2019t wearing waterproof mascara. The producers actually received letters asking why she didn\u2019t think to apply makeup that would withstand her tears.\u201cThe mascara thing just happened, and it became a thing. Most of the time when we were shooting, we would be sitting on their balcony, like six or seven of us crammed on this tiny little balcony. You\u2019re watching little monitors, and when you get that like black eyeliner roll, you\u2019re just like, \u2018Damn, this is so great,\u2019 because again, we don\u2019t have those [to-camera] confessionals \u2014 those OTF\u2019s we call them in the business \u2014 so we have no other device to tell stories other than something like a black mascara line running down her face. You clearly notice she\u2019s upset, and that\u2019s so far and few between. Other than the help of music, that\u2019s really all we have, so those were extremely helpful to us and they kind of became Lauren\u2019s hallmark\u2026 We got so many letters that were like, \u2018Why didn\u2019t she wear waterproof mascara?,\u2019 and I never could answer that. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cI think it might have been slowed down in the trailer, but not in the show. It would be a little strange in the episode when we\u2019re supposed to be in a kind of real-time scene for [the tear] to slow down. We would joke that we\u2019d have these scenes where Lauren is finally going to talk to Audrina, and we would swear that Lauren would wear the runny mascara where because of that, she would literally \u2018win\u2019 the scene. They\u2019re both crying, and Audrina\u2019s mascara wouldn\u2019t run, and Lauren\u2019s would. Therefore, our hearts would go out to Lauren. We thought, \u2018Does she do it on purpose? Does she wear the runny mascara because she wants to [win]?\u2019 I mean, I don\u2019t think so. She tries so hard not to cry. She used to say, \u2018Guys, I'm so tired of crying on the show.\u2019\u201d",

Exposure to the sun's harmful UV rays boosts your risk of skin cancer, and studies suggest that people who use tanning beds triple their risk of melanoma.\n\nThat said, we get it: sometimes you still want that bronzed, just-back-from-the-beach glow (minus the skin cancer risk, of course). That's why there are hundreds of skin-safe self-tanning options out there that can take you from pale and pasty to sunny and summery in minutes. But as anyone who's ever wound up with streaky, orange skin can attest, not all of these products are created equal.\n\nTo the rescue: Amazon. Why test out dozens of tanning lotions, liquids, and mousses yourself when you can trust the thousands of reviewers to do the work for you? Each of these highly rated products has racked up a 5-star rating of at least 50% (if not more). Pick one that suits your preferred price range and application method, and get ready to glow all summer.",

Period,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of the stories are horrific and need to be brought to light. This story, about my husband, Carter Oosterhouse, on the other hand, is now taking it too far and boundaries are being crossed.\u201d\n\nOosterhouse \u2014 who has appeared on TLC\u2019s Trading Spaces (and is slated to star in the show\u2019s reboot in spring 2018) and HGTV shows including Carter Can and Red Hot & Green \u2014 was accused of sexual misconduct by a former makeup artist in an article published by The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday.\n\nDavid Livingston/Getty\n\nKailey Kaminsky, who worked on Carter Can in 2008, told THR in an interview that Oosterhouse, 41, had coerced her into performing repeated oral sex acts during the show\u2019s production. She claims she interpreted his requests as affecting her livelihood, which is why she agreed to a sexual relationship with him. The experiences allegedly led to her hospitalization for depression and her being let go from the show, she said.\n\nBut Oosterhouse denies his sexual relationship with Kaminsky as being nonconsensual, stating, \u201cIt was 100% mutual and consensual. In no way did I ever feel, nor was it ever indicated to me, that Kailey was uncomfortable during out intimate relationship. I would have never done anything that I was not sure was mutually agreeable.\u201d He also claimed Kaminsky initiated their relations the first time and \u201cthe 15 or so times we had relations thereafter.\u201d\n\nAmy Smart/Instagram\n\nIn her statement on Saturday, Smart reiterated Oosterhouse\u2019s point. \u201cWhen you are in a CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIP, then you need to take responsibility for engaging in that and not play victim,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIF a relationship does not work out the way you want it to, then sorry, but that is the risk you take when getting intimate with another person. There are plenty of relationships I wish I could go back and make different choices about, but it was on me to decide.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to take responsibility and learn from our mistakes and choices,\u201d she continued. \u201cWomen are powerful and we need to be reminded of the strength and power we hold and learn ways to take care of ourselves so we don\u2019t find ourselves saying yes when we really need to say no.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: ABC Has Pulled The Great American Baking Show Off the Air\n\nSmart said Kaminsky\u2019s claims were \u201cvery damaging and cruel to one of the most kindest, loving, non-aggressive men I have the privilege of knowing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so sorry for these salacious words being thrown around, they are extremely hurtful,\u201d she said, addressing the media. \u201cThis type of reporting needs to stop, it\u2019s so damaging for personal lives and careers and just not fair. Enough is enough, this is a plea to the writers, outlets and media\u2026 More due diligence needs to be done before crafting headlines and stories. Have discernment when you tell a story and please consider the source and story before just printing anything to get readers and viewers.\u201d\n\nShe ended her note, \u201c#lovethesetwo.\u201d\n\nOosterhouse told PEOPLE in a statement that he is \u201cvery passionate about what is happening right now with the #metoo movement, especially because I have so many strong women in my life, like my wife, mother, sister and of course my little baby girl. We are in a time of change for society and I am behind it 100%.\u201d\n\nHis latest TV project, ABC\u2019s The Great Christmas Light Fight, will air on the network on Monday as scheduled.

In fact, she didn't even want to audition for the role in the first place, she tells The Hollywood Reporter in a candid, funny and occasionally profane interview. She wanted to be a movie star. Pompeo grew up in Everett, Massachusetts, a suburb outside of Boston, where she lived with her father, grandfather and siblings. Her mother died unexpectedly when Pompeo was five, which fed her insecurities. \"I didn't have a mother to tell me how amazing I was,\" she told Good Housekeeping.\n\nEllen Pompeo as Meredith Grey on ABC's \"Grey's Anatomy.\" Richard Cartwright | Disney ABC Television Group | Getty Images\n\nAfter high school, Pompeo worked as a bartender until her father encouraged her to pursue acting. Her breakout moment came in 2002 when she landed a role as the love interest in \"Midnight Mile.\" That marked her first appearance on the big screen. She went on to nab parts in \"Old School\" and \"Daredevil\" but, by 2004, Pompeo's career had hit a wall and she was almost broke. When her agent brought her the script for \"Grey's,\" Pompeo balked. \"I was like, 'I'm not going to be stuck on a medical show for five years,'\" she says. \"'Are you out of your f------ mind? I'm an actress.'\" However, he convinced her to audition anyway, if only to pay her rent. He predicted that the pilot wouldn't even air and Pompeo's fear of getting \"stuck\" on a medical drama would never come to fruition. But not only did \"Grey's Anatomy\" air, it became an instant hit. \"I knew I was f-----,\" Pompeo tells The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAfter three seasons, Pompeo had the chance to leave the show or extend her contract. She knew she wasn't likely to find a better role anywhere else, so she stayed put. \"I was 36,\" she tells Good Housekeeping. \"I knew as a woman in the [movie] business that I wasn't going to be paid the same as men.\" (Indeed, Hollywood's male leads notoriously make millions more than its female stars.) With \"Grey's\" now in its 14th season, Pompeo is one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood, earning more than $20 million a year, according to The Hollywood Reporter. She'll receive $575,000 per episode, a seven-figure signing bonus, producing fees and back-end equity in the deal, among other perks. To get there, Pompeo had to learn it wasn't \"being greedy\" to ask for what she was worth. \"For me, Patrick [Dempsey] leaving the show [in 2015] was a defining moment, deal-wise. They could always use him as leverage against me \u2014 'We don't need you; we have Patrick' \u2014 which they did for years,\" she says. Pompeo recalls a time when she asked to be paid $5,000 more than Dempsey on principle, since she was the Grey in \"Grey's Anatomy,\" after all. The studio turned her down. But Pompeo didn't give up, either on her show or on her ambition.\n\nEllen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey on \"Grey's Anatomy.\" Scott Garfield | Disney ABC Television Group | Getty Images",

She played Julie on Friends.\n\nContents show]\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nTom, a Chinese American, was born in Highland Park, Illinois, the daughter of Nancy (n\u00e9e Dare) and Chan Tom, who worked in the frozen food business. She was born on the same day as President Barack Obama: August 4, 1961. She was raised Catholic. In an article for Detour Magazine, Tom describes an experience she had as a child where other children were teasing her about her Chinese heritage. This caused her to become a rather introverted person which, in turn, is what originally inspired her to get into dancing.\n\nTheater\n\nAt the age of 17, Tom landed a spot with a touring company of A Chorus Line. She was cast in the Broadway version of the show less than a year later. She won an Obie Award for her off-broadway acting, and she's been in such other Broadway shows as Hurlyburly and Doonesbury. During her six years in New York Theatre, Tom worked with directors Peter Sellars and Joanne Akalaitis.\n\nFilm\n\nTom had several small parts in movies including Nothing Lasts Forever, Wall Street, See No Evil, Hear No Evil, and Blue Steel; but her biggest role to date was as a waitress in the Robin Williams/Tim Robbins film Cadillac Man. This role led to being a guest on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. Tom landed a starring role in the film The Joy Luck Club in 1993, which led to roles in such other films such as When a Man Loves a Woman and North.\n\nSince the mid-90s, Tom has starred in few films (focusing her work, primarily, in the voiceover business), with the exceptions of a supporting role in the 2003 hit comedy Bad Santa and the critically-acclaimed 2004 film In Good Company.\n\nTelevision\n\nLauren Tom's first role in television was that of Miko Wakamatsu on The Facts of Life. She subsequently appeared on The Equalizer, thirtysomething, Quantum Leap, Chicago Hope, Homicide: Life on the Street, Grace Under Fire and Pretty Little Liars, Supernatural, and a starring role in DAG, The Division, Monk, My Wife and Kids, Barbershop: The Series, Grey's Anatomy, Andi Mack, The Closer, and Men in Trees. On Friends, Lauren Tom played Ross' second season girlfriend, Julie.\n\nVoice acting\n\nTom began vocal work in the animated series Superman: The Animated Series (as Angela Chen). From there Lauren had minor roles on Pinky and the Brain, Extreme Ghostbusters and The Zeta Project before landing her lasting roles on King of the Hill and later Futurama.\n\nShe has also lent her voice to All Grown Up!, Rocket Power, Max Steel, Batman Beyond, Justice League Unlimited, Kim Possible, Numbuh Three (and Adult Numbuh Three in the episode \"Operation: I.N.T.E.R.V.I.E.W.S.\") and Numbuhs 44 and 45 on Codename: Kids Next Door, Teen Titans, Yan Lin, Susan, Alchemy on W.I.T.C.H., The Replacements, Legion of Super Heroes, Jake's mom, Counselor Chang on American Dragon: Jake Long, and Avatar the Last Airbender (as Joo Dee).\n\nOther animated movies Tom has voiced include Mulan II, Kim Possible: The Secret Files, Kim Possible Movie: So The Drama, Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, the four Futurama movies Bender's Big Score, The Beast with a Billion Backs, Bender's Game, and Into the Wild Green Yonder.",

Perhaps the money was worth the spandex.\n\nThe latest Bacon question: Is he really singing the praises of President Donald Trump?\n\nIn the depressing age of fake news, there is a dual responsibility to identify the difference between news that is actually false or fabricated and news that simply rubs us the wrong way, generally because it comes with a slant or there are omissions that would otherwise provide a more comprehensive picture.\n\nWe can decidedly say that a recent story claiming Kevin Bacon believes we are all \"blessed\" to have Donald Trump as our president is utterly untrue.\n\nThe dubious news blog Worldwide Politics published a story on Sunday recapping a supposed interview Kevin Bacon had on ABC's \"This Week With George Stephanopoulos.\" During this interview, the actor reportedly gushed over President Trump.\n\n\u201cI honestly think that we are blessed to have him as President \u2013 he is the only one who can take care of all this mess,\" Bacon supposedly said. \u201cHe should be given the Medal of Freedom for talking his mind in such a bold, honest, and straightforward manner.\u201d\n\nBacon, of course, campaigned for John Edwards in 2007 and later donated to Barack Obama in 2008, officially endorsing the former president during his successful re-election bid in 2012. That's not to say some Obama voters didn't shift their support to Trump in 2016, but little about Bacon's political past suggests he would have done so himself.\n\nHere's the kicker: Kevin Bacon last appeared on \"This Week\" in 2007 and never spoke a word about Donald Trump.\n\nWorldwide Politics is the epitome of a fake news website. It's also not the only one that traffics in falsified celebrity news. Late last month, the Daily News for Americans ran a made-up story claiming actress Julia Roberts \u2014 an attendee of the Women's March in Washington, D.C. \u2014 called Trump \"the best president in US history.\"\n\nThe only place this Kevin Bacon story may have legs, in other words, is in a game of \"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.\"",

        "content": "Erin Jensen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nActor Anthony Edwards accused writer/producer Gary Goddard of molesting him in an essay that was published on Medium Friday.\n\nEdwards says he first met Goddard when he was 12, at the beginning of his acting career, which included roles in films like 1982's Fast Times at Ridgemont High and 1984's Revenge of the Nerds. He is best known for the 1986 film Top Gun and the NBC medical drama ER, in which he played Dr. Mark Greene from 1994 to 2008.\n\nThe actor, now 55, said Goddard, 63, taught him \"the value of acting,\" and served as a leader for Edwards' group of friends. Edwards says Goddard also used the void of his emotionally unavailable father to manipulate him.\n\n\"Everyone has the need to bond, and I was no exception,\" said Edwards. \"My vulnerability was exploited. I was molested by Goddard, my best friend was raped by him \u2014 and this went on for years. The group of us, the gang, stayed quiet.\"\n\nGoddard directed the 1987 live-action He-Man film Masters of the Universe. He later founded the Goddard Group, an entertainment design firm. It produced 2009's Tony Award-winning revival of the musical Hair as well as several theme-park attractions for Universal Studios and Six Flags.\n\nEdwards said that he came face to face with Goddard at an airport 22 years ago and was able to confront his alleged abuser.\n\n\"I was able to express my outrage at what he had done,\" he wrote. \"He swore to his remorse and said that he had gotten help. I felt a temporary sense of relief. I say temporary because when Goddard appeared in the press four years ago for alleged sexual abuse, my rage resurfaced. At 51 years old, I was directed by a group of loving friends to a therapist who specializes in this kind of abuse.\"\n\nEdwards was likely referring to a pair of 2014 lawsuits accusing Goddard of sexually abusing teenage males. One suit was brought by an anonymous British citizen; the other was filed in federal court in Hawaii by Michael Egan III, who eventually withdrew his complaint against Goddard.\n\nThe ER star continued, \"Only after I was able to separate my experience, process it, and put it in its place could I accept this truth: My abuse may always be with me, but it does not own me.\"\n\nHe concluded, \"I did not go from being a victim to a survivor alone. No one does. I had to ask for help, and I am so grateful that I did.\"\n\nGoddard's press representative Sam Singer put out a statement late Friday \"unequivocally\" denying Edward's charges.\n\n\u201cGary first met Anthony more than 40 years ago. Gary was a mentor, teacher and a friend to Anthony, which makes this story all the more disturbing to him,\" Singer said in a statement. \"As to the allegations that Mr. Edwards made in his post today, I can unequivocally deny them on Gary\u2019s behalf. Gary played an important role in helping start Anthony\u2019s acting career and acted as his personal manager. He has nothing but the greatest respect for Anthony as a person.\"\n\nSinger added: \"Gary is saddened by the false allegations. The post by Anthony, as well as many of the news stories today reference a legal claim made against Gary approximately four years ago regarding sexual harassment. The complaint was demonstrated to be fraudulent as it was completely fabricated, and ultimately withdrawn by the complainant and his attorneys.\u201d\n\nGoddard's current project, the film Broadway 4D, which he wrote and co-directed with Bryan Singer, is due next year.\n\nYou can read Edwards' essay in its entirety here.\n\nMore:Louis C.K. apologizes for his sexual misconduct: 'These stories are true'\n\nMore:Kevin Spacey scandal: A complete list of the 14 accusers\n\nMore:List: All of the Hollywood power players accused of sexual assault or harassment",

Pak Chong Mar, 72, sliced his wrists with a boxcutter at about 7:50 a.m. after screaming 'The IRS is trying to take my money! I\u2019m not a freeloader!' witnesses told The Post.\n\nThe story only mentions \"Today\" show host Lauer in passing -- as having come out of Rock Center with colleague Al Roker to briefly look at what was happening. But it does make a point of describing Lauer as \"reeling since the Ann Curry fiasco.\" (Yes, surely Lauer's well-documented clash with former co-host Curry was top-of-mind as he surveyed a scene the Post described as including \"gushing blood.\")\n\nKeepin' it classy as always, New York Post.\n\nUPDATE: Separately, the New York Post is cutting 13 full-time positions, via Romenesko.\n\nSimon Dumenco is the \"Media Guy\" columnist for Advertising Age.

        "content": "This post contains spoilers for Stranger Things 2.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering throughout the second season of Stranger Things whether Noah Schnapp, who plays the once-missing \u201czombie boy\u201d Will Byers, ever lost his voice from all that screaming, the answer is a definite \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nWill spent most of the Netflix drama\u2019s first season lost in the Upside Down. But this time around, he\u2019s got a lot more screen time: he\u2019s back in school, where bullies make fun of him; he keeps having terrifying \u201cepisodes\u201d that expose him to the shadowy realm that co-exists with his sleepy Indiana hometown; and, perhaps most importantly, he\u2019s got to decide how he feels about his prospective stepdad, played by none other than nerd royalty Sean Astin. Though this season holds many great surprises, one of its best is the skill and sensitivity with which Schnapp plays Will\u2014turning what could have been a flat scream-fest into something more deeply resonant. At times, staring into Will\u2019s wide, terrified eyes, it\u2019s hard not to feel his isolation and terror.\n\nIn an interview with V.F., Schnapp outlined tackling some of this season\u2019s greatest challenges\u2014including, yes, losing his voice for three days from screaming so much in the finale.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the massive success of Season 1 made the experience of filming Season 2 a little different. Security was beefed up: the cast\u2019s scripts had to be \u201call rounded up and given to this one guy, so he could burn it or something,\u201d according to Schnapp. And, yes, there were several meetings outlining what the cast could and could not discuss publicly\u2014though plenty of people have still tried to coax spoilers out of the actor. \u201cThey\u2019ll say it like, \u2018So I know this is happening. Can you just confirm it?\u2019 . . . People are very sneaky, but we\u2019ve been drilled in not to say anything.\u201d\n\nThe biggest challenge for Schnapp is one of relatability: \u201cI\u2019ve never been stuck in the Upside Down, and no one else I know has, so it was kind of something new to just create,\u201d Schnapp said. His inspirations? Schnapp read stories and myths about people who had been possessed, then did his best to put himself in Will\u2019s shoes. We won\u2019t spoil the finale, but Will does spend one particularly harrowing scene screaming his lungs out. Although the Duffers initially instructed Schnapp not to strain his voice\u2014the actual screaming sounds would be edited and added in later\u2014he went for it anyway; as the actor explained, \u201cit felt really weird [to have] my mouth open but not screaming.\u201d Eventually, he paid the price.\n\n\u201cI was screaming and screaming,\u201d Schnapp said. His voice held out for a full day of shooting\u2014\u201dbut then the next morning I woke up, and I just\u2014I\u2019d open my mouth, and nothing came out for the next three days.\u201d\n\nChallenges like this are part of the Stranger Things deal, but it\u2019s also got its perks\u2014like meeting Astin, whom Schnapp described as \u201cso cool.\u201d",

Additionally, the Twitter account that originally posted the clip has been removed.\n\nOn Monday, Mosley took to Instagram to share a statement condemning the prevalence of sex tape leaks and the culture that he feels excuses it.\n\n\"We have to change this culture of abuse and assault against women. Today\u2019s post saddens me deeply as it is an attack not only against my client but my friend,\" Mosley wrote. \"Why do we think it\u2019s acceptable to sell, or publish, or seek revenge, or blackmail women in this way and without their consent? It\u2019s not.\"\n\nThe high-profile attorney then implored men to \"do better.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m tired of telling my clients to not make videos because the men will put them out later.

We need to stop sharing these videos with each other in the club, at the barbershop or (and especially) online.\"\n\nMosely concluded by calling it a \"morally corrupt action,\" one that is criminal in the state of California.\n\n\"Maybe it is time to set an example,\" he wrote.\n\nAttorney Lisa Bloom, who represented Chyna during her lawsuit against her ex-fiance, Rob Kardashian, last year, took to Twitter to explain the dangers of illegally posting sex tapes.\n\n\"Revenge porn -- posting explicit images without the consent of everyone in those images -- is a crime, a civil wrong, and a form of domestic abuse,\" Bloom wrote, without referring to Chyna by name in her posts. \"It's also a way to try to slut shame women for being sexual. Girls have killed themselves over revenge porn. It's not a joke.\"\n\nBloom also responded to a critic who dismissed the outrage because, they claimed, Chyna \"knew [the man] was recording.\"\n\n\"Whether a woman knows she's being recorded is not the issue. Whether she consented to posting is,\" Bloom tweeted. \"Our bodies, our choice, each and every time.\"\n\nET has reached out to Chyna's attorney for comment.\n\nCurrently, Chyna is involved in a lawsuit against several members of the Kardashian family -- including her ex, Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner.

They met and hooked up within an hour of starting to film the season on June 4.\n\n\u201cWe got turnt up,\u201d he recalled of their encounter. Though the incident was caught on tape, ABC only aired their interactions leading up when Paradise premiered last week. \u201cWe\u2019re at the bar, we\u2019re hanging out. One thing leads to another and we\u2019re making out \u2026 The pool gets a little intense and I didn\u2019t think anything of it.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWho would say \u2018no\u2019 to Corinne?\u201d\n\nWithin days, an allegation of sexual misconduct between the pair launched an on-set investigation that suspended filming for nearly two weeks. Ultimately, producers Warner Bros. Television found no misconduct and resumed filming on the Mexico set.\n\nJackson reiterated what he had previously told The Hollywood Reporter, that a third party filed the complaint and he remains confused about why the show shut down if the issue didn\u2019t stem from him or Olympios. The third-party complaint was filed by a producer, who Jackson claims he only knows as Olympios\u2018 best friend. (Olympios\u2018 rep said Jackson should refer his questions to proucers.) Jackson said that producer, along with a second producer who later filed a similar complaint, left set before he did.\n\nABC has not provided any details about the producers, or what motivated them to file their complaints.\n\n\u201cI never once thought that I would be here, today, speaking to you guys amid a crazy scandal,\u201d he said, admitting that the whole situation, coming on the heels of his disastrous Bachelorette stint, made him reevaluate himself and his decisions.\n\nHe then broke down in tears recounting what he and his family then went through, especially his mother.\n\n\u201cYou were being accused of sexual assault,\u201d said Harrison.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s every man\u2019s biggest fear,\u201d he replied.\n\nRecalling a false report that stated he took a \u201climp Corinne\u201d out of the pool and had \u201csex with her,\u201d Jackson said, \u201cI know I\u2019m not that monster they\u2019re trying to portray on TV.\u201d\n\nHe also noted the \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cintense\u201d slut-shaming Olympios experienced on her end. The pair has yet to speak.\n\nThe sit-down broke the traditional format on the summer spinoff series and resembled the Bachelor and Bachelorette post-show special, After the Final Rose, with franchise alums and castmembers making appearances before a live audience. The studio edition aired during the second half of Tuesday\u2019s episode, following an hour of traditional Paradise drama.\n\nBefore Jackson made his entrance, Harrison spoke to castmembers Raven Gates, Jasmine Goode, Derek Peth, Diggy Moreland and Robby Hayes. All five contestants were part of the original cast who were there for the shutdown.\n\nOnce again, the castmembers relived what happened, how production shut down and the fallout, pointing fingers away from the show and towards the media and public jury.\n\n\u201cIt was disgusting how they were portraying DeMario as someone that committed this \u2018sexual assault crime,'\u201d Gates said of the media coverage. \u201cReading those articles, there was maybe 10 percent of information that we connected with and 90 percent that was just made up,\u201d added Peth.\n\nGoode said the cast witnessed what happened and from what they saw, no one was a victim, referencing Olympios\u2018 statement made during the investigation. \u201cI thought she was into him and I thought he was into her,\u201d she said.\n\nNext week ABC will air Harrison\u2019s one-on-one sit-down with Olympios, who has been less outspoken in sharing her experience.\n\nShortly after the controversy broke, the 25-year-old said, \u201cI am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened on June 4.\u201d ABC reality chief Robert Mills told THR that Olympios will clarify what she meant.\n\n\u201cShe says, \u2018I used the word victim, but let me explain what that meant,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI think she felt badly about what DeMario went through as well, so you\u2019ll see both of them discussing that. They had these statements that completely got twisted or misconstrued where it was being asked what they meant. I think they wanted to say in a stronger, more expansive forum, \u2018This is what I meant by that. \u2026 This is my version of what happened that night.\u2019 And just get the story out there so we can put this thing to bed once and for all.\u201d",

I did like 14 movies in six years. It\u2019s a lot. I was away from home a lot, I was away from school. I needed to grow and develop as a person. I was actually looking forward to going to school.

Clark, are seeking more than $1 million in damages and non-monetary relief, as well.\n\nGaines\u2019 spokesman declined to comment on the suit, but his attorney, Jordan Mayfield, told KWTX Thursday, \u201cWe are confident that these claims will be found to be meritless, and it is disappointing to see people try to take advantage of the hard work and success of Chip and Joanna Gaines.\"\n\nLewis and Clark were equal partners with Gaines in founding the Magnolia Real Estate Company in 2007.\n\nThe suit says that for the first six years, the company largely operated in Waco with a single real estate agent.\n\nThe suit claims Gaines worked out a deal with HGTV for the \u201cFixer Upper\u201d program without telling his partners and that Gaines planned on featuring the Magnolia brand name.\n\nGaines bought their shares of Magnolia Real estate for $2,500 each, the suit says.\n\n\"With this insider information in hand, Chip Gaines convinced plaintiffs to sell their membership interests in Magnolia Realty quickly to him before a public announcement that \u201cFixer Upper\u201d was picked up by HGTV.\"\n\nThe suit, which also names Magnolia Realty, Scripps Networks Interactive, Scripps networks LLC and High Noon Entertainment which produces the show, claims Gaines pressured Lewis and Clark to sell \u201cbefore they discovered the company\u2019s value was radically enhanced by \u2018Fixer Upper.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen Clark balked at the terms of the buyout, the suit alleges Gaines sent a text advising Lewis to tell Clark \u201cto be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t come from the nerdy prep school he\u2019s from. And when people talk to me that way they get their asses kicked. And if he\u2019s not ready to do that he better shut his mouth. I\u2019m not the toughest guy there is, but I can assure you that would not end well for [R]ick,\u201d the text read, according to the suit.\n\nSince the show debuted, the suit says, Magnolia has grown from a single-agent firm to one that employs \u201cover 93 real estate agents, and a support staff, and now operates in nearly every major city in Texas.\u201d\n\nIn addition to monetary damages, the suit seeks rescission of the sale of the company or fair value for Lewis\u2019 and Clark\u2019s interest, payment of salaries, bonuses in-kind benefits and distributions they would have received as partners",

Nobody has to be pissed off on my behalf. I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\nPolanski was arrested in 1977 for five offenses following the alleged assault, including rape by use of drugs, perversion, sodomy, and lewd and lascivious acts upon a child under 14. He fled the country after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a minor.\n\nTarantino has been engulfed in controversy in recent days. In a New York Times article, Uma Thurman said the director pressured her to perform a dangerous car stunt during the shooting of \u201cKill Bill\u201d that led to an injury to the actress. The \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d director has also been highly scrutinized over his professional relationship with Harvey Weinstein, the indie mogul who has been accused of assault and rape by dozens of women. The director acknowledged that he knew that his ex-girlfriend Mira Sorvino was assaulted by Weinstein, but continued to make movies for the producer for decades.\n\n\u201cI knew enough to do more than I did,\u201d Tarantino told the New York Times in October shortly after reports of Weinstein\u2019s abuse and harassment broke. \u201cThere was more to it than just the normal rumors, the normal gossip. It wasn\u2019t secondhand. I knew he did a couple of these things. I wish I had taken responsibility for what I heard. If I had done the work I should have done then, I would have had to not work with him.\u201d\n\nTarantino has a number of high-profile films in the works that could be derailed by the backlash. He\u2019s directing Leonardo DiCaprio in a drama sat against the backdrop of the Charles Manson murders and is developing a \u201cStar Trek\u201d movie for Paramount. The Manson film is being backed by Sony Pictures. Manson\u2019s followers murdered Polanski\u2019s wife Sharon Tate in 1969.\n\nHere\u2019s Tarantino\u2019s full statement, first reported by Indiewire:\n\nI want to publicly apologize to Samantha Geimer for my cavalier remarks on \u201cThe Howard Stern Show\u201d speculating about her and the crime that was committed against her. Fifteen years later, I realize how wrong I was. Ms. Geimer WAS raped by Roman Polanski. When Howard brought up Polanski, I incorrectly played devil\u2019s advocate in the debate for the sake of being provocative. I didn\u2019t take Ms. Geimer\u2019s feelings into consideration and for that I am truly sorry.\n\nSo, Ms. Geimer, I was ignorant, and insensitive, and above all, incorrect.\n\nI am sorry Samantha.\n\nQuentin Tarantino",

After luring her into the evidence room via an elaborate scheme involving Fake Charles and her favorite show The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Jake has his Amy recite the inscription on the winner\u2019s cummerbund, which reads, \u201cAmy Santiago, will you marry me?\u201d\n\nThen Amy turns to Jake, who\u2019s down on one knee, and the most adorable exchange precedes his popping of the question:\n\nAfter Amy says yes to Jake\u2019s proposal, Charles storms into the evidence room. He learns his best friends are engaged, grows overwhelmed and then immediately passes out (because of course he does).\n\nLater, everyone gathers at the bar to toast the engagement. Jake recalls phoning Victor to ask for Amy\u2019s hand in marriage, which instead resulted in an awkward voicemail where he proclaimed that Amy is \u201ca strong, independent woman and she don\u2019t need no man!\u201d (Suffice it to say, Jimmy Smits\u2019 inevitable return for the wedding should be a lot of fun.)\n\nThen Terry and Charles try taking credit for the proposal. Terry thinks he gave Jake the idea when he waxed poetic about mixing vanilla and blueberry yogurt back at the precinct; Charles thinks he put the idea in his head when he interrupted Jake and Amy\u2019s meet-cute back in 2009 and insisted he heard wedding bells. But as it turns out, Jake knew he was going to ask Amy to marry him for months, having come to the \u201cdope\u201d romantic epiphany when she freaked out over a random crossword typo.\n\nDetective\u2019s log:\n\n* I love how much Holt loves the annual Halloween heist at this point. Not only is he sitting at the foot of Jake and Amy\u2019s bed waiting for them to get up at 3 am to get a head start, but he interrupts their engagement celebration to make sure everyone knows that no one won. (\u201cGet over it, \u2018ya jag!\u201d)\n\n* When Jake and Holt rip open each other\u2019s button-down shirts, you actually hear the buttons falling to the floor. Even funnier, Terry yells, \u201cEverybody stop undressing! We just had harassment training!\u201d\n\n* Holt, when he finds out the corgi he\u2019s walking isn\u2019t actually his dog, exclaims, \u201cYou\u2019re not Cheddar! You\u2019re just some common bitch!\u201d\n\n* Throughout the week, pretty much everyone fed Terry GPS tracking devices, so he now has at least six of them lining his intestinal tract.\n\n* Gina isn\u2019t in the episode (Chelsea Peretti is still on maternity leave), but it\u2019s implied that the character gave birth to a healthy baby girl.\n\n* Charles thinks the phrase \u201chook, line and sinker\u201d is actually \u201chook, line and sphincter,\u201d because \u201cthat\u2019s where you put the hook in when you\u2019re eeling!\u201d\n\n* While it\u2019s probably too soon to start talking wedding plans, it\u2019s safe to assume Charles is going to try and fulfill the duties of best man and bridesmaid, yes?

ABC would likely wait for the studio to lock in the actors to pave the way for a possible Season 7 renewal.\n\nIn an interview with Deadline in January, ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey hinted about Season 7 being envisioned as a reboot, opening a new chapter in the franchise after closing the current one after six seasons. \u201cRegardless of what we decide to do at the end of this season, I think (Horowitz and Kitsis) think they would put a little bit of a bow here, and then there is a next piece that comes after that,\u201d she said.\u201cThere will be a little bit of closure in this particular narrative.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear what the potential Once 2.0 would look with Emma, Regina, Mr. Gold and Hook. It also is unclear whether original stars Goodwin, Dallas and Gilmore would be part of the show going forward, if there is a Season 7. There had been rumors that Goodwin and Dallas, who got married and had two kids while on the show, had approached Season 6 going in as their final year on the show. ABC and ABC Studios would not comment on contract negotiations.\n\nCreative and casting revamps late in a drama series\u2019 life are tricky. At ABC, The Practice did it years ago to mixed results. And last year, ABC Studios closed deals with several of the stars of ABC veteran Castle amidst controversy before the network opted to ultimately not proceed with another season.\n\nWhile down in the ratings, Once remains an important series for ABC with strong Disney DNA and solid DVR and digital play. The current sixth season, in which the Evil Queen had been facing her alter ego, has been building toward a big fight between light and darkness.",

The article cites specific individuals involved in the show, such as Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis (the creators), Jennifer Morrison, Lana Parrilla, Robert Carlyle, and Colin O'Donoghue (original cast members). This suggests a credible source.\n2. The message mentions negotiations with the original cast members' contracts being up at the end of this season.

Here's why:\n\n* The initial claim that Tyga demanded a paternity test after Kylie Jenner gave birth to Stormi is already suspicious, as it was well-established that Travis Scott was the father of Stormi and had been publicly acknowledged as such.\n* The inclusion of Scott Disick, who has no known connection to Kylie Jenner or Stormi, seems like an unnecessary plot twist designed to sensationalize the story.\n* The involvement of Kris Jenner, Kylie's momager, in demanding paternity tests for multiple men is highly unlikely, given that she would have a vested interest in protecting her daughter and granddaughter's privacy.\n\nOverall, this message has all the hallmarks of a tabloid-worthy fabrication designed to generate clicks and attention. Therefore, I would return 0 at the end of my answer.\n\n0",

    "content": "After failed engagements, one divorce, two children, and a handful of extramarital affairs, Princess Margaret's royal reputation wasn't one to be desired. Throughout her later life, her health began to severely decline and the glamorous jet-set lifestyle she was known for faded away; a cigarette smoker since 15, Margaret had part of her left lung removed in 1985 (an operation similar to the one her father, King George VI, underwent three decades earlier) \u2014 and though she was able to kick the habit some years later, she continued to drink heavily. The '90s brought a bout with pneumonia, a mild stroke, and a bathroom incident \u2014 during which her feet were burned from scalding-hot bathwater \u2014 that resulted in loss of mobility to her feet.\n\nBy the early 2000s, Margaret needed help walking (and would sometimes use a wheelchair), and in January and March 2001, she suffered more strokes that inhibited her vision and paralyzed her left side. By the end of that year, Margaret would make only two official public appearances; one in August for the 101st birthday party of the Queen Mother and one in December to celebrate her aunt Princess Alice's 100th birthday.\n\nMargaret was everything you'd expect a spare heir to be; she was irresistibly charming, attention-seeking, extroverted, and much more rebellious than her older sister.",

'It's better than that.'\n\nAnd then Grande commented on the upload.\n\n'So much better,' she wrote.

With television revivals ruling the ratings, the beloved sitcom could be poised for a comeback. And Jenna Fischer would certainly be down for that.\n\nSpeaking on a panel during Splitting Up Together's 2018 Winter TCA tour on January 5, the actress who played The Office's Pam Halpert fielded a question about the show's potential return. Now, before you get too excited to return to Scranton, Pennsylvania, know that nothing is official.\n\nFischer claimed that she hasn't heard anything about a revival of the show from the powers that be. \"I think that\u2019s for networks to figure out,\" she said. \"I haven\u2019t been approached about it and don\u2019t know anything about it \u2026 But I love Pam!\u201d\n\nLater, the actress added: \"I think the idea of an Office revival is a great idea. I would be honored to come back in any way that I am able to. I loved playing that character and as long as [co-creator] Greg Daniels is the person in charge and the visionary behind it, then I would absolutely be up for it.\"\n\nFrom her past comments, it's clear that Fischer also wouldn't mind reuniting with her onscreen love interest, John Krasinski.

While coaching jumpers at Azusa Pacific University in California, Nieto attempted to demonstrate his signature move, but after his foot slipped on the track Nieto landed on his neck. He woke up the next morning in the hospital and was almost fully paralyzed; he could barely move his shoulders. Some doctors warned he would never be able to walk again.Further complicating the matter, Nieto did not have health insurance. But he was determined to eventually make a complete recovery. To aid his efforts, the track community came together and raised over $81,000 for his medical bills through crowdfunding via AthleteBiz -- the same organization that later set up Gabe Grunewald's crowdfund , which has already raised over $54,000.Soon after the incident, Nieto proposed to his girlfriend Shevon Stoddart with the promise that on their wedding day he would walk all the way down the aisle unassisted. (Stoddart is no slouch herself: she's a two-time Olympian in the 400m hurdles for Jamaica.)Yesterday, Nieto made good on his promise, and took his steps up to the altar, completing a huge milestone on his long road to recovery.\"People keep saying my recovery is really fast,\" Nieto said to the AP . \"I feel like it's not fast enough. I want to be better tomorrow. I'm built for speed, not for going slow. But I'm working on being the best walker I can be.\"Watch Nieto take his final steps to the altar:",

Some Angelenos, on the other hand, say the event itself will benefit few, while the decade-long polishing of the city\u2019s image will harm many.\n\nWith this series of stories, Curbed is starting a dialogue about how past games have changed the city\u2014for better and for worse\u2014and how city leaders can use those lessons to put forth the best games for everyone.\n\nThis series looks at what made 1932 and 1984 so successful, from deploying budget-friendly design to virtually eliminating traffic.

They were then \u201cwhisked up to the Queen\u2019s private sitting room\u201d for the hour-long meeting, Kay reports. (We assume her no-fail, go-to jeanswere not her choice of attire for this particular occasion!)\n\nSplash News Online\n\nLater that evening, Harry was in top form as he accepted a posthumous award honoring the HIV/AIDS activism of his mother, Princess Diana, at the Attitude magazine awards.\n\nSpokespeople at Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the report.\n\nThere is critical significance in Markle\u2019s meeting with the Queen. Harry is fifth in the line of succession (he\u2019ll be pushed to sixth after William and Kate welcome their third baby this spring), meaning he has to have the monarch\u2019s permission to wed.\n\nThere had been rumors that the Suits star and the Queen may have met earlier \u2014 during a visit to Balmoral Castle in Scotland.\n\nLast month, Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, made their public debut as a couple at the Invictus Games in Toronto, where they held hands at a wheelchair tennis event and spent time with her mom, Doria. Before the games, Markle had spoken in a way that no other royal girlfriend or boyfriend had done so before, saying they were \u201ctwo people who are really happy and in love.\u201d\n\nKarwai Tang/WireImage\n\nAnd if there is any doubt that Harry would need to worry about securing his grandmother\u2019s approval, one inside source tells PEOPLE he would be in the clear. \u201cIf Harry asks for something, she would say yes as she adores him,\u201d the source says.\n\nIf they are to wed, there are suggestions it would take place at St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nLast week was a busy one for the royals: The Queen, 91, returned from her annual Scottish summer getaway, and Harry helped host a party for mental health professionals in the palace on Tuesday. This week has been active as well, with Harry joining his grandmother on Tuesday for a private reception of the Queen\u2019s Commonwealth Trust, a fledgling charity. Harry \u2013 who features on the organization\u2019s new website \u2014 has taken a prominent role in several projects for the Commonwealth, especially based around young people and the environment.",

And it returns with its original stars \u2014 Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Megan Mullally and Sean Hayes \u2014 and creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan.\n\nIf you saw the original series finale, you may remember that it ended with Will and Grace happily partnered \u2014 Will with Vince, Grace with Leo \u2014 and raising children. Well, when the show returns, the partners and the children will be forgotten.\n\n\"That was more or less a fantasy,\" Kohan says. \"It was a projection into the future. ... What we missed was the dynamic between the four of them more than we missed the possibility of seeing what they were like as parents.\"\n\nAdds Mutchnick, \"We never would have gone in that direction if we weren't ending the show.\"\n\nMORE: What to expect from your favorite TV shows\n\nWhen Will first aired, NBC asked the writers to stress the friendships among the characters and downplay the fact that two of them, Will and Jack, were gay.\n\nThat's all changed, says McCormack. \"Now the message is 'we are us,' and we represent a lot of people in the country, gay and straight, and we're not apologizing for who we are.\"\n\nIt can be hard to try to recapture past glories, but Hayes says the cast immediately fell back into their old groove. \"We've all become brothers and sisters and family. Moving forward with the show, it fits like a glove.\"\n\n\"When we sat down together, it just came to life in ways I'd never seen before or since,\" says Messing. \"I think of comedy as music, and each one of us is a different instrument. And when we play together, we're at our best.\"\n\nThe only difference in the way they play now, says Mullally, is that they have to stretch to warm up before they do the physical comedy \u2014 something they didn't have to do when they were 11 years younger.\n\nThere's another difference: Hayes, who was in the closet when Will originally aired, is now out. While he says he wishes he had come out earlier, he just wasn't ready.\n\n\"At the time, I didn't have the DNA to speak for a whole community. I didn't have the words to do that, and I wish I did. But now I find that words come easier.\"\n\nThe world, of course, is a far different place than it was in the '90s, and Mutchnick says the show will reflect what is happening in America today, in politics and otherwise. \"The show has always been relevant,\" says Hayes. \"And under the umbrella of relevancy is everything.\"\n\nSo, are they worried about committing to a second season before the first even airs? No way, says Messing.\n\n\"We all got together and read, and it felt like coming home. For the last year, it's been a confusing time, and I haven't laughed a lot. To come back together and to laugh out loud? .. It's a no brainer.\"\n\nAdds Hayes: \"There's nothing to fear. We've been playing these characters. I play him at the Grove every time I go shopping.\"",

On Thursday, Robert Vazquez, a spokesman for the no-kill animal shelter, gave a stinging interview to Yahoo denying that Dunham's dog was as mistreated as she claimed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just hard to believe the dog was nasty when she took Lamby to every green room with her when Girls was still a thing four years ago,\" he said, noting that he wouldn't have adopted the dog out if he felt it had insurmountable issues.\n\nVazquez also took issue with Dunham's claims that Lamby had \u201cthree other homes (and) three other names\u201d before she owned him.\n\n\u201cWe checked the records for Lamby ... He was \u2018owner-surrendered\" he said, adding that it was because the owner said they didn't have enough time for him. \"So we do not know where she got \u2018multiple owners that abused the dog,\"\n\nIn an Instagrampost Thursday night, Dunham shared a painting of Lamby that hangs in her home, while defending her version of events in the caption. \"It's come to my attention that the staff at the shelter where I adopted Lamby have a very different account of his early life and behavioral issues than I do. While I'm sorry to have disappointed them, I can't apologize,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I have weathered a lot of micro-scandals but this one hurts MOST, because of the vulnerability of letting people know Lamby and my story, and because I miss him so damn much,\" she continued. This is the painting that greets me every day when I walk into my home. This is the animal who taught me about loving and letting go. I know I'm a lot of fun to place your issues on, but I won't let anyone hang their hat on this peg. Not this time.\"\n\nDunham isn't the only celebrity angering animal advocates this week. Katy Perry, who visited Australia to promote her upcoming tour, appeared in an ad for a n Australian department store chain, where she tells her dog Nugget to \"go chase some koalas.\"\n\nApparently, that's a big no-no in a country where koalas are endangered species and dogs are among their biggest threats. \"[It's] inappropriate on so many levels,\" an Australian wildlife expert told the country's Courier-Mail newspaper. \"Perry is a role model to so many young people, and this just destroys all the good work we do to try to encourage people not to let their dogs come into contact with koalas.\"\n\nWatch the original ad below, which has since been re-edited without Perry's offending line.",

The hip-hop mogul is facing at least 13 accusations of sexual harassment and rape, and is the subject of a New York City police department special victims unit investigation.\n\nSimmons has repeatedly denied accusations against him, including in court documents filed on 4 April, in which he denied raping film-maker Jennifer Jarosik, who attempted to sue him for $5m (\u00a33.68m) \u2013 the lawsuit was later dismissed. In a statement posted to his Instagram account as the caption to an image that stated, \u201cShoutout to black women just because\u201d, Simmons reiterated this position, but accepted the net benefits of the #MeToo movement: \u201cA little blood on my shoulders so that my daughters see a better world is worth it.\u201d\n\nAllow Instagram content?

In November 2017, Simmons stepped down from his role in Def Jam records, the label he cofounded with Rick Rubin, along with his yoga lifestyle brand, other media properties and CNNMoney. HBO removed his name from All Def Comedy, a series he created to showcase up-and-coming comedians.\n\nIn response to allegations of sexual assault from screenwriter Jenny Lumet last November, Simmons wrote: \u201cWhile her memory of that evening is very different from mine, it is now clear to me that her feelings of fear and intimidation are real. While I have never been violent, I have been thoughtless and insensitive in some of my relationships over many decades and I sincerely apologise.\u201d\n\nFollowing four further accusations of rape in December 2017, Simmons posted another now-deleted statement to Instagram, pledging to clear his name: \u201cToday, I begin to properly defend myself. I will prove without any doubt that I am innocent of all rape charges,\u201d Simmons posted, beneath an image that read #NOTME.\n\nAllow Instagram content?

The next day he told me with a big smile on his face, \u2018I really enjoyed last night,'\u201d Gotterba told the Enquirer.\n\nDouglas Gotterba in undated photo\n\nHe said Travolta, 58, took him on more romantic trips to Hawaii, Amsterdam and Kenya.\n\n\u201cSometimes he\u2019d bring women along as beards, but he would ask me to join him in his suite and we\u2019d spend the nights together. It was our little secret,\u201d Gotterba claimed.\n\nThe pilot said he encouraged Travolta to get a girlfriend as cover, and that\u2019s when the actor started dating Brooke Shields.\n\n\u201cThere was no chemistry between them. They\u2019d smile for the cameras and everyone assumed they were a couple,\u201d he said.\n\nThe affair ended in 1986 after growing tensions, Gotterba said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d show up on my door many times, unannounced, to check up on me,\u201d the pilot told the Enquirer. \u201cHe\u2019d disappear into my bedroom and go through my drawers. He always tried to catch me cheating on him.\u201d\n\nHe said Travolta would ignore him for days if he didn\u2019t drop everything to be with him on a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nTheir last meeting was years later in 1992, after Travolta married actress Kelly Preston.\n\n\u201cWe were making small talk when suddenly, I blurted out, \u2018So, John, tell me. Now that you\u2019re married, do you still prefer men \u2013 or women?'\u201d Gotterba said he asked. \u201cWell, Doug, I still prefer men,\u201d Travolta replied, according to Gotterba.\n\nThe Enquirer report follows three months after two anonymous masseurs \u2013 John Does 1 and 2 \u2013 filed and later dropped federal lawsuits claiming Travolta groped them during massages.\n\nThe first Doe withdrew his legal claim after Travolta proved he was in New York on the day of the alleged Beverly Hills attack.\n\nTravolta\u2019s camp immediately dismissed the Enquirer\u2019s interview with Gotterba.\n\n\u201cThis ridiculous so-called \u2018new\u2019 story is a retread of a story published a few weeks ago by the same desperate supermarket tabloid \u2013 the same tabloid that impossibly claimed that John Travolta had an encounter with \u2018Doe #1\u2019 in Beverly Hills when he was actually on the east coast working on a movie,\u201d Travolta\u2019s rep said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nndillon@nydailynews.com",

Furthermore, the hacker issued a warning to the HBO officials that if they fail to pay the ransom within a couple of days, the leaked data will be dumped onto the dark web.\n\nWhen FBI was pressed into the probe, it discovered that the data was leaked as soon as the hackers got hold of the email credentials of Leslie Cohen, HBO\u2019s Vice President for film programming.\n\nSince, HBO failed to react to the hacker\u2019s call, few episodes of \u201cGame of Thornes\u201d containing the water mark \u201c HBO is Falling\u201d were leaked to the web. After two days time details such as emails, financial balance sheets, employment agreements and marketing strategies also emerged on the web.\n\nOn Wednesday night this week, a hacking group named \u201c OurMine\u201d gained access to the Twitter accounts of HBO.

I even went home and a couple months went by and I was in the dermatologist for something [else].\" While there, Tamra had the dermatologist give it a look when she \"was literally out the door\" and that's when the doctor made the call to biopsy the mark.\n\n\"She called me in the car and was like, 'You have melanoma.' And I'm like, 'Oh my gosh.' I was not expecting that at all,\" Tamra said. \"It was only at Stage 1, so I was lucky. But if she hadn't said anything [in Iceland], I probably wouldn't have had it checked.\"\n\nShe said, of learning the news, that \"it wasn't fun\" and keeping a closer eye on her health has now become the norm for her.\n\nRelated\n\n\"I have to get checked every three months and so I go in and get a full body check just to see. And every time I go in, I get three or four things cut off,\" she said. \"[I have that] white, freckly skin.

So [in] my generation, there's a rise in melanoma.\"\n\nTamra is one of several Bravo stars who have been diagnosed with skin cancer as of late, including Andy Cohen, Bethenny Frankel, and Camille Grammer.

If you watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians or read Kourtney\u2019s blog, you might have noticed just how passionate the reality star is about natural beauty.\n\nAhead, we take a look at some of Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s beauty secrets for natural skin care, including what natural deodorant she uses and how she keeps her skin hydrated with manuka honey.\n\nCoconut oil\n\nSuperfood ingredients such as coconut oil have made their mark on natural skin care and beauty products. And, like many natural beauty devotees, Kourtney is no stranger to its beauty benefits. On top of using the natural oil in her hair, the reality star likes to moisturize her body with it, too. According to her app, Kourtney applies coconut oil to her body skin \u201cright out of the shower\u201d and let it sit for 10 minutes.\n\nIn addition, the reality star uses coconut oil in some homemade beauty recipes, too. One of Kourtney\u2019s go-to\u2019s? A DIY lip scrub made with coconut oil, manuka honey, and sugar. The natural concoction gently sloughs off dry skin and nourishes for a silky soft, smooth, lipstick-ready pout.\n\nManuka honey\n\nAnother all-natural ingredient Kourtney Kardashian swears by for skin care? Manuka honey. The reality star is a big fan of Manuka Doctor skin care products and also swears by the all-natural superfood honey for home skin treatments.\n\nThanks to its natural humectants and anti-aging properties, manuka honey can be used in beauty for many things. For soft, hydrated skin, more youthful-looking skin, apply manuka honey to the complexion as a face mask and let it sit for about 10 minutes before rinsing. You can also add it to homemade beauty product or as a spot treatment on pimples. In addition to being anti-aging and hydrating, manuka honey also boasts anti-bacterial properties that can help combat breakouts and keep the complexion clear.\n\ngood morning A post shared by Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Oct 7, 2017 at 10:57am PDT\n\nNatural deodorant\n\nLike other celebrities and wellness aficionados, Kourtney no longer uses chemical-ridden deodorants and switched to a natural deodorant. \u201cChanging over to an all-natural deodorant seemed like an important thing to do when I heard that when people are diagnosed with breast cancer, they are told to immediately discontinue using conventional antiperspirants and deodorants,\u201d the reality star shared in a blog post. \u201cAlthough research connecting the parabens and aluminum from these products directly with breast cancer is inconclusive, I like to play it safe,\u201d she concluded.\n\nSo, what natural deodorant does Kourtney swear by? Schmidt\u2019s Natural Ylang Ylang + Calendula deodorant. At $8.99 a pop, the natural deodorant is more affordable than other other natural brands. In addition, it features an award-winning formula made with essential oils and free of aluminum, parabens, propylene glycol, and phthalates.\n\nNatural sunscreen\n\nDeodorant isn\u2019t the only natural skin product Kourtney likes to use. As a California native, the reality star knows how crucial it is to protect her skin from the sun. That said, like many of her products, she prefers a more natural formula. Her favorite natural sunscreen? Drunk Elephant Umbra Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!",

    "content": "Kylie Jenner is pretty busy thanks to having a casual billion-dollar (almost) beauty empire, a reality TV show, and a new baby girl. She also happens to maintain a pretty solid health and fitness routine, which is an impressive and inspiring feat regardless of how busy you are. Wanna know exactly how she does it? Of course you do.\n\n1. She Exercises on Her Terms\n\nUnlike her siblings who go hard at the gym and chronicle everything from leg day to beach yoga on their social media, Kylie seems to work out infrequently. Actually, she only recently started getting into a regular gym routine post-baby.\n\n\"I planned my first workout for Monday,\" Kylie said during a Q&A with her best friend Jordyn Woods, which she filmed after she'd given birth to Stormi. \"I'm not even doing it to get in shape.\"\n\nSo how does Kylie exercise when she does feels like it? Thanks to Instagram, we know she takes walks with Baby Stormi, and goes paddle boarding (which both happen to double as photo opps, ahem):\n\nStrong is sexy, and clearly Kylie knows it.\n\n2. She Eats Fast Food When She Craves It\n\nAnyone who follows Kylie on Snapchat knows she loves In-N-Out Burger (saaaaame). The fast food was her biggest pregnancy craving, because\u2014as she explained to her doctor in her birth announcement video\u2014\"It\u2019s just In-N-Out these days literally tastes like...nothing I\u2019ve ever had.\"\n\n3. But She Also Tries to Eat Organic Meals\n\nWhen she's not indulging her In-N-Out cravings, Kylie tends to eat organic foods. \"Kylie eats like a typical teenager but she's also super aware of what she puts in her body when it comes to fresh and organic foods,\" Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian once said of her sister's daily diet.\n\n4. She Can't Eat Dairy\n\nKylie is lactose intolerant, so completely cutting out dairy had a big impact on her overall health. \"I didn't realize I was lactose intolerant. I just became lactose intolerant, like, this year,\" she explained back in 2015. Once she stopped consuming dairy, Kylie told E! News that she naturally slimmed down.\n\nFYI, if you're wondering whether it's common to develop lactose intolerance later in life, the answer is yes! You could even say it's pretty typical: The NIH reports that \"approximately 65 percent of the human population has a reduced ability to digest lactose after infancy.\"\n\n5. She's All About Home Cooking\n\nCooking at home is a great way to maintain a balanced diet, since you can make a cheesy (or in Kylie's case, a cheese-free) pizza topped with pepperoni one night, and a grain bowl packed with veggies the next. \"I love cooking these days,\" Kylie said in 2016. \"I like to make burgers. I also make spaghetti because my mom is obsessed with spaghetti. It's the first thing I learned to cook. I love potatoes; I'll make all different kinds of potatoes, like scalloped potatoes, mashed potatoes, candied yams.\"\n\nKylie often showcases her cooking adventures on social media. Here's some yummy footage of bacon from her Snapchat:\n\nP.S. Travis Scott has also revealed that she makes a mean peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The more you know!\n\n6. She Realized Cleanses Are BS\n\nKylie has absolutely no tolerance for them\u2014as evidenced by the one time she documented her attempt at a juice cleanse on Snapchat, only lasted three drinks, and then decided to get sushi instead.\n\n7. She Rarely (If Ever) Touches Alcohol\n\nThere's nothing wrong with kicking back with a glass of wine, but Kylie\u2014who is still under 21\u2014hadn't drunk a drop of booze as of August 2017. \"You know, I've never had a drink before,\" she admitted in an interview. None of Kardashian-Jenner sisters are big drinkers (Khlo\u00e9 is the only one who even dabbles), so perhaps Kylie inherited this preference from her fam.\n\n8. She Works Out with Her Family\n\nBack in 2016, Kylie revealed that she works out with Kourtney and uses the same trainer as Kanye West:\n\nI work out with [my sister] Kourtney and her trainer, who is also Kanye's trainer. We work out for an hour. It's hard, but it makes me feel good. Kourtney likes to blast music. I'm really into Kanye's new songs. PartyNextDoor has a song called 'Party at 8,' which my friends and I have been listening to on repeat.\n\nBut even when she's breaking a sweat with a group, she does it on her terms. Khlo\u00e9 explained it best in a blog post on her website:\n\nKylie doesn't really work out. She did come with Kourt and me one time, when [our trainer] Don was training us. Don does four quarters in each session and Kylie only stayed for one quarter. When she was leaving, we were like, 'Hello?' She's like, 'No, I'm OK. I'm not feeling this.' And she just walked away. She doesn't have any remorse, either. We were like, 'Kylie, you only did one quarter!' and she's like, 'That's all I wanted to do.' OK then\u2014you do you, Kylie!\n\n9. She Gets Seven Hours of Sleep a Night\n\nSleeping well has a huge impact on your energy levels and mood throughout the day, and despite her jam-packed schedule, Kylie gets close to eight hours of ZZZs every night. Or at least she did before she had a baby! Back in 2016, her day started at 7:00 a.m. and ended around midnight when she hit the hay.\n\n10. She Embraced the Normal and Healthy Changes Her Body Went Through Throughout Her Pregnancy\n\nKylie says her body changed a lot during her pregnancy (which, reminder, is to be expected!), and while it's certainly been an adjustment, she's embraced it. \"At such a young age to see your body go through such a change, and it is physically, mentally, and emotionally, a challenge,\" she said in her Q&A with Jordyn. \"It's also a beautiful thing, and it was such a great pregnancy and birth and I'm so happy and I would have done the same thing over again.\"\n\nSo very here for Kylie's positive relationship with exercise, food, and the physical changes her body has gone through!\n\nRelated Story What Meghan Markle Does to Get Fit",

(Photo by Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images)\n\nBy far one of the best embodiments of a comic book character on screen has to be Hugh Jackman.\n\nHis take on Wolverine over the course of about two decades was great. It was also the high point of just about every X-Men film. When his run finally ended with this year\u2019s Logan, many of us held out some hope to see him dawn the classic blue and yellow costume from the comics.\n\nJust like his close friend Deadpool\u2019s Ryan Reynolds, Jackman is known to jump on Twitter to have some fun with fans. Yesterday morning, Jackman went on Twitter to tease fans about what he\u2019s going to wear for Halloween this year.\n\nJust maybe I will finally wear blue and yellow spandex for my #halloweencostume #tootall pic.twitter.com/0IwL6GoHzZ \u2014 Hugh Jackman (@RealHughJackman) October 26, 2017\n\nThat\u2019s right, Hugh Jackman might finally be in the classic Wolverine costume. But not how we would have wanted to see.\n\nLogan Director James Mangold spoke with Screenrant.com about the issue with the yellow costume months ago and why it didn\u2019t work to put it in the movie.\n\nI always feel a certain contingent of fans who are yearning for it. But the biggest block I\u2019ve had \u2013 I\u2019m willing to take the heat for it \u2013 is that, I can never get past, being a writer for these movies as well, that Logan is the least narcissistic of all the superheroes, any kind I can think of \u2013 Marvel, DC or anywhere else. What I mean by that is, who puts a special branded outfit on when they do good deeds? And why? The only reason you do it is so you can have some sort of trademarked claim and get credit for what you did. Nothing seems less Wolverine-like than the desire to put on a trademarked outfit , particularly canary yellow, and kind of prance about doing good deeds and have people go, \u201cOh my God! It\u2019s The Wolverine!\u201d At least the Wolverine, as I see him, that\u2019s a real struggle for me and always has been. I somehow feel that if somehow we ever put Hugh [Jackman] into one of those outfits, people would not be happy. Essentially, it\u2019s something that lives on the page and I\u2019m not sure could live anywhere else.\n\nPersonally, I would have loved to see him run around in a big old yellow costume ripping people up. Unless you\u2019re going to trick or treat with the Aussie actor you won\u2019t get to see him in his full yellow glory.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping a photo of Jackman with the costume on makes it online!",

He says it's because Logan is depicted as being humble and not wanting to draw attention to himself, which makes the idea of him wearing a trademarked outfit like the classic Wolverine costume seem out of character.\n\nGiven this information, I believe that Hugh Jackman's tweet is more likely to be a joke or a tease rather than an actual announcement. He's known for having fun with fans on Twitter, and this tweet seems like a playful way to get people excited about Halloween without actually committing to dressing up as Wolverine.

It wasn\u2019t appointment television for her to see Tom and others she has dated.\u201d\n\nWhen Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston broke up months ago, rumors swirled in regard to possible arguments and tension over their highly-publicized relationship. However, according to the Hollywood Life source, Taylor Swift holds no ill will for her ex-boyfriend.\n\nAs for Taylor Swift\u2019s decision against watching the awards show, the source claimed the Golden Globes simply weren\u2019t something she was focused on. That said, she reportedly believes Hiddleston deserved the award he received.\n\n\u201c[Taylor Swift] likes being part of award shows but if she has no part of it she chooses to not focus much attention on it. But she is happy that Tom won, she feels that it was well deserved,\u201d the source explained.\n\nTaylor Swift began dating Tom Hiddleston in June of last year, just weeks after her relationship with Calvin Harris came to an end after 15 months, and right away, several photos of the former couple on the beach together hit the web. Then, for weeks, Taylor Swift\u2019s romance with Hiddleston continued to be documented with photos of the two of them in several different countries, including the U.K., Italy, and Australia.\n\nTaylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston enjoyed a months-long whirlwind romance until sometime in September when E! News confirmed they had split amid rumors of a potential dispute over their romance and the amount of attention they were getting.\n\n\u201cTaylor felt he wanted to take the relationship to be too public, and she was not happy about it and thought it was too much publicity,\u201d a source told the outlet.\n\nDuring Taylor Swift\u2019s romance with Tom Hiddleston, the actor was seen wearing an \u201cI [love] T.S.\u201d T-shirt during a beach party, and although they dated for just a few months, they were both believed to have met one another\u2019s parents.\n\nAs Taylor Swift continues to face rumors regarding her potential feelings towards Tom Hiddleston and his recent award win, the singer is rumored to be working on a new album. While Swift has yet to make her future plans for new music official, she has been regularly releasing new music since her first album in 2006 and was reportedly inspired to create new songs after her split from Hiddleston.\n\n\u201c[Taylor Swift] is handling things well and she is working on music and writing lyrics down all the time especially since she has been involved in so many recent high profile news stories with [Tom Hiddleston] or [Kanye West] and even the Super Bowl speculation,\u201d a source told Hollywood Life. \u201cShe has a lot of material to work off.\u201d\n\nA new album is \u201cstill a work in progress because when she puts something out she wants to fully support it with a tour and television appearances,\u201d the source continued. \u201cShe is enjoying a little break so there is still some time for all of that.\u201d\n\nSince splitting from Hiddleston last year, Taylor Swift has been keeping a low profile as she focuses on her career and friendships with her popular girl squad, which includes Lily Aldridge and Gigi Hadid.\n\n[Featured Image by Jason Merritt/Getty Images]",

Brown also requested to terminate the court\u2019s ability to award spousal support in her filing. (PEOPLE confirmed in July Brown was ordered to pay Belafonte $40,000 per month in temporary spousal support and pay for $140,000 in attorney fees and forensic fees on Belafonte\u2019s behalf.)\n\nAmid her restraining order filings in April, Brown claimed that Belafonte hired a German exchange student, Lorraine Gilles, to be their nanny and pitted the two women against each other. Brown claimed the nanny\u2019s relationship with Belafonte became sexual and that he impregnated her before demanding an abortion.\n\nShe was granted a restraining order against Gilles in April, but Gilles in turn sued Brown for defamation, claiming her pregnancy was the result of a one-night stand. Their battle remains unresolved.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Forced Threesomes and Injury Coverups: The Biggest Bombshell Allegations from Mel B\u2019s Restraining Order Against Her Ex\n\nMeanwhile in October, new details of Brown and Belafonte\u2019s marriage emerged in a court proceeding in Los Angeles, with Brown claiming Belafonte drugged her throughout \u201cmuch to most\u201d of the relationship, according to his lawyer, Philip Cohen, as reported by multiple outlets.\n\n\u201cMiss Brown now takes the position she was drugged by Mr. Belafonte throughout the course of the marriage,\u201d Cohen said in L.A. Superior Court. Belafonte and his legal team responded to Brown\u2019s allegations, claiming they are \u201cnothing more than a smear campaign.\u201d\n\nAlso in court in October, Brown\u2019s lawyers said Belafonte had at least 56 videos, a third of which were \u201cof a sexual nature,\u201d according to The Sun. Susan Wiesner, a member of Brown\u2019s legal team, said \u201c90 percent\u201d of the videos were of the former Spice Girl and were made without Brown\u2019s consent. Belafonte\u2019s lawyers dismissed the claim, arguing that the videos were \u201cconsensual.\u201d\n\nHearings between Brown and Belafonte\u2019s legal teams remain ongoing.",

Basically, he just lip-synced to another singer\u2019s voice and the world took it as his own.\n\nZac has since owned up to the fact that it was a singer by the name of Drew Seeley whose voice HSM fanatics fell in love with and not his.

There have been a lot of conflicting reports about the state of the couple\u2019s tortured relationship in the last week, but I trust the Kardashians\u2019 official news network, E!, to have the most honest version of events.\n\nE! reported yesterday that Richie ended things with Disick after he was spotted getting handsy with a \u201cmystery blonde\u201d at Kanye West\u2019s album release party in Wyoming. (It\u2019s interesting that Richie, who has been dating Disick for over a year \u2014 my God \u2014 wasn\u2019t invited to the release party in the first place. I think that shows the Kardashians still have a long way to go in terms of accepting the relationship.) The breakup, however, lasted just 48 hours, as Disick quickly won Richie back with promises to \u201cchange.\u201d\n\nAccording to E!, Richie has been living at Disick\u2019s house in L.A., but she stayed at her father Lionel Richie\u2019s house during the short separation. \u201cLionel and her family encouraged the split and are very upset and disappointed that she decided to get back with him,\u201d a source told the site.\n\nUs Weekly reported last week that Lionel threatened to cut Sofia out of his will if she continued her relationship with Disick. But Sofia seems committed: She referred to Disick as her \u201cwhole [heart emoji]\u201d on Instagram yesterday. Please pray that all relevant parties see reason soon.\n\nKendall Jenner, who once comically referred to Richie as one of Disick\u2019s children, kissed someone in public. That someone is Anwar Hadid, the 18-year-old model brother of Jenner\u2019s friends Gigi and Bella Hadid. TMZ got a photo of the pair making out at an after-party for the CFDAs Monday night. According to the gossip site, \u201cKendall was hangin\u2019 with Anwar at Socialista New York for about 2 hours \u2014 kissing, cuddling and drinking with the youngest Hadid sibling the whole time.\u201d\n\nWill Gigi and Bella be upset? Who cares! Jenner never does anything fun, and this sounds fun. She also never shows PDA with anyone she reportedly dates. (Blake Griffin, Ben Simmons, A$AP Rocky \u2026) Maybe Anwar is the one.\n\nGigi Hadid, meanwhile, looks to be back together with her ex-boyfriend Zayn Malik. And Bella has been spotted hanging out several times with her ex-boyfriend the Weeknd. Everyone is happy.\n\nIn other new celeb relationship news, Jennifer Lawrence reportedly has a new boyfriend. According to \u201cPage Six,\u201d his name is Cooke Maroney, and he is a director at New York\u2019s Gladstone Gallery. A source told the gossip site, \u201cThey met through Jen\u2019s friend Laura \u2026 The relationship has been going on a few weeks. But they have been very private and careful not to be seen together.\u201d This is exactly the thing a \u201csource\u201d would say before a new couple is about to be seen together. Keep your eyes on the Daily Mail!\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\n\u201cPage Six\u201d says that Maroney is 33, which is great. It\u2019s a nice age for a boyfriend to be, when you\u2019re 27, which Lawrence is. A terrible age for a boyfriend to be is: 49.\n\nOne Small Blessing\n\n\u201cAudrina Patridge is the happiest she\u2019s ever been since reuniting with Ryan Cabrera.\u201d\n\nBlind Item of the Week\n\nAnd here\u2019s an interesting blind item from this week, care of Enty at the best site for blind items, Crazy Days and Nights:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he acts enough any longer to be permanently A or A- list, but this former A+ list mostly movie actor cheated on his wife the night before they got married. He called it a cleanse. Uh huh.\u201d\n\nWho could it be? Richard Gere recently got married. So did Hugh Grant. Put your guess in the comments or speak it to the wind!\n\nFinally, I\u2019ll leave you with this photo of Emma Stone and Justin Theroux \u201changing out\u201d in a bungalow at the Hotel du Cap Eden Roc in the south of France last week. Both stars, who have been rumored to be dating since they left Rihanna\u2019s Met Gala after-party together, were in town for the Louis Vuitton cruise show. Stone told reporters Theroux was like her \u201cbrother\u201d at the show. Does this look like a brother-sister relationship to you?

And that includes the film\u2019s climatic helicopter chase scene.\n\nIn an interview for the film\u2019s upcoming Blu-Ray release, Cruise\u2019s leading lady in the film, Rebecca Ferguson, discussed a scene where Cruise\u2019s character, Ethan Hunt, dangles from the underside of a flying helicopter. Then, Ethan loses his grip on the helicopter, dropping onto a cargo load being lifted by the helicopter and grabbing onto it to avoid plummeting to his death in the canyon below.\n\nFerguson saw Cruise as he did the fall and, not noticing that he had a safety harness, thought that he had just killed himself.\n\n\u201cI heard myself scream. I actually thought he fell,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere was an audible gasp from the crowd. That\u2019s a huge drop,\u201d co-star Henry Cavill added in the Blu-Ray interview.\n\nWhat was worse for Cruise is that he shot that stunt five times, only to move on to another death-defying sequence in which he flew a helicopter through the mountains at low-altitude for a chase scene that required him to get dangerously close to another helicopter.\n\nOh, and he also performed the highest free fall skydive ever filmed for a movie and broke his leg while jumping between buildings in London. As we noted this past summer, you wouldn\u2019t be faulted for thinking that Tom Cruise might have a death wish.\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout\u201d is available on Digital Nov. 20, and on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD on Dec. 4.",

    "content": "Robin Williams\u2019s August 2014 suicide was devastating to those who knew him best\u2014and it also came at the end of a long and difficult decline, as this excerpt from New York Times culture reporter Dave Itzkoff\u2019s new biography, Robin, demonstrates. In the months that preceded his death, Williams faced daunting challenges, both professionally and personally. His film career had stalled, and his comeback sitcom, The Crazy Ones, was failing to find an audience on CBS. He was still harboring guilt about his divorce from Marsha Garces, his second wife and mother of two of his children, and adjusting to life with his new wife, Susan Schneider, whom he married in 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, Williams was also reeling from a cataclysmic diagnosis: in May 2014, he had been told that he had Parkinson\u2019s disease, news that stunned and overwhelmed the once-nimble comedian. Even more crushing than this is the possibility that Williams was misdiagnosed; an autopsy would later reveal that he actually had Lewy body dementia, an aggressive and incurable brain disorder that has an associated risk of suicide.\n\nHere, Itzkoff traces the last few months of Williams\u2019s life. His reporting draws on the perspectives of some of Williams\u2019s closest confidants and family members, including Billy Crystal; his Mork & Mindy co-star Pam Dawber; his oldest son, Zak Williams; his daughter-in-law, Alex Mallick-Williams; his makeup artist, Cheri Minns; and his old friends Mark Pitta, Cyndi McHale, and Wendy Asher. Robin is available May 15.\n\nCourtesy of Macmillan Publishers.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt was a question that crossed Robin\u2019s mind more often these days, now that he had put in roughly 35 years as a professional entertainer and more than 60 as a human being.\n\nWhat did he still get out of doing what he was doing, and why did he feel the compulsion to keep doing it? He had already enjoyed nearly all of the accomplishments that one could hope for in his field, tasted the richest successes, won most of the major awards. Every stage of his career had been an adventure into the unknown, an improvisation in its own right, but there was truly no road map for where he was now. Everything came to an end at some point; it was a reality he accepted and confronted so often in his work, even as he tried to out-race it. What would it look like for him, he wondered, when he wrapped things up and told the crowd good night for the last time? How could it be anything other than devastating?\n\nThe work was less abundant than it used to be and nowhere near as lucrative, and so much of it seemed to be focused on finality, particularly in the form of death. In August 2012, he had appeared in an episode of Louie, the cable-TV comedy written by and starring the comedian Louis C.K., that begins with both men meeting at the grave of a comedy-club manager who has recently died, and whom they both privately despised. \u201cWhen he died, I felt nothing,\u201d Louie tells Robin. \u201cI didn\u2019t care. But I knew\u2014when I pictured him going in the ground and nobody\u2019s there, he\u2019s alone, it gave me nightmares.\u201d Robin replies, \u201cMe too.\u201d",

The star is still very focused on his shared children with Angie and, apparently, things have never been better between the actor and his youngsters! While Brad reportedly doesn\u2019t see the kids every single day, he has been spending time with them regularly, which has apparently brought him tons of happiness!

Click here to see adorable pics of the Jolie-Pitt kids then and now.\n\n\u201cDating hasn\u2019t been a priority because Brad wants to spend more time with the children,\u201d a source for ET told the publication. \u201cHe has been working on himself. Brad has been spending a lot of time learning to play guitar and hanging with musician friends.\u201d When he\u2019s with the kids though, they\u2019re 100 percent his main focus, according to the publication, and he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way! \u201cThe children continue to live with Angelina full-time, but they visit Brad at his house a few days a week,\u201d the site\u2019s insider added. \u201cThey don\u2019t spend full days with him, just a few hours, and they\u2019re either accompanied by bodyguards or their nannies.\u201d\n\nBrad has apparently been so consumed with making sure his kids are doing well, that dating has even been put on the back burner in some respects. \u201cHe loves those kids,\u201d the source continued. \u201cThey have been and always will be his first priority.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean the actor isn\u2019t dating at ALL though.

    "content": "Stagecoach Outfits\n\nStagecoach outfits are a crucial element of this beloved California country music festival. Every year, Stagecoach fashion helps set the mood for this massive, three-day fest. Inspired by their favorite country musicians, fans from across the country pull out their finest western-inspired clothes to enjoy live music at Empire Polo Field in Indio, Calif.\n\nA photo posted by @stagecoach on Apr 25, 2015 at 2:51pm PDT\n\nKeep reading for tips on what to wear to Stagecoach this year (for both girls and guys). You can also view a collection of past Stagecoach outfits when you jump to the bottom of the page.\n\nDress for the Weather\n\nWith average highs in the upper 80s and average lows in the 60s, weather in Indio, Calif., can change drastically from midday to midnight, as well as from day to day. Your best bet for the daytime is light-colored, lightweight clothing. Make sure it\u2019s something you\u2019ll be comfortable wearing for a full day outside. Since the nights can get chilly in Indio, it\u2019s not a bad idea to bring a jacket or flannel to layer on top.\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to make sure you\u2019re wearing comfortable, durable shoes. The terrain is not very smooth at Empire Polo Field, and things can get messy when thousands of people convene in one spot for three days.\n\nPro-Tip: Sunscreen is a must in the California desert. You can bring your own from home, but make sure it\u2019s non-aerosol. (Security will make you toss out any aerosol containers at the festival entrance.)\n\nA photo posted by @stagecoach on Nov 30, 2015 at 4:03pm PST\n\nWhat to Expect in Stagecoach Fashion\n\nStagecoach fashion is definitely one-of-a-kind. Put country music lovers in the California desert and you\u2019ll get some interesting (and some outrageous) outfits. Expect to see lots of cowboy boots and hats, American flag apparel, and swimsuits on both men and women.\n\nFor Girls: With the warm weather, lots of female Stagecoach outfits include jean shorts (think Daisy Dukes) and tank tops. Some even opt for just swimsuit tops to battle the midday heat. There\u2019s also a strong tradition of wearing western-inspired dresses, particularly in colors like white or dusty rose.\n\nFor Guys: Take the cowboy theme into serious consideration if you\u2019re planning men\u2019s Stagecoach outfits. Jeans, plaid button downs, cowboy boots, and even cowboy hats are fixtures of Stagecoach fashion. American flag-themed apparel is also pretty abundant. In past years, guys have worn American flag swimming trunks, bro tanks, socks, sunglasses, and even fanny packs to Stagecoach.\n\nView some of our favorite Stagecoach outfits via our Pinterest board below.",

Luann reportedly pleaded not guilty following her arrest, according to TMZ. She rejected a plea deal in connection with the case in February.\n\nThe judge set a court date for July 25 during which Luann is set to plead guilty in absentia and the adjudication will be withheld, her attorney said, according to CBS12.com.\n\nRHONY fans saw Luann in the moments leading up to her arrest, as well as footage of the incident and her mugshot in Wednesday night's episode (clip above). We'll see the aftermath of Luann's arrest in next Wednesday night's episode of RHONY at 9/8c.\n\nRelated\n\nIn the below preview clip from the episode, Luann explains that she flew to Palm Beach to spend time with a friend on her way to a wedding in Chile and to also spend Christmas with her family in Jupiter, Florida. While there, Luann ended up visiting several places she used to frequent when she was with her now-ex-husband Tom D'Agostino. \"I thought I could handle it, but let me tell you, all these emotions coming back, all these memories came back. And, you know, I'm not blaming it on that, per se, it's just that all of it together was just too much for me to handle,\" Luann tells Dorinda Medley on the phone in the clip. \"I'm not proud of what happened, that's for sure. I'm not proud of what I did, but I'm learning a lot about myself. I found the right place to be to take care of myself.\"\n\nLuann Checks in With Dorinda After Her Arrest\n\nNot long after her arrest, Luann checked herself into an alcohol treatment center, where she stayed for 21 days before returning home in January. Luann opened up to The Daily Dish earlier this season about how we'll see her \"crash and burn\" and then \"rise like a phoenix.\" \"I think when you're happy, you always look better, and I'm happy that I lost weight because I stopped drinking, which is good. So I'm less puffy. I feel so much better. And I feel like when you feel good about yourself, it comes shining through,\" she shared. \"There's a big change in my life in terms of being in control, being in power, being in the driver's seat, and I feel like with the drinking, I definitely was not in the driver's seat.\"\n\nWatch Luann open up more about her journey this year, below.",

In the most recent season, Peters played a cult leader who pursues political power following Donald Trump\u2019s presidential win, while Paulson played a woman traumatized by the victory.\n\nMurphy, the cast, and crew typically wait closer until the premiere date to announce the theme for each season, leaving fans of the scary anthology to speculate and search for small clues. Social media users are currently convinced that season 8 will be titled \u201cRadioactive.\u201d\n\nWhen EW asked Murphy about the buzz, he responded, \u201cI heard about that rumor. Well, that\u2019s based on a fact that we\u2019ve cleared a lot of titles for that show.\u201d He continued, \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting idea. I can neither confirm nor deny.\u201d",

The seventh season was a creative reboot for the show, which lost core cast members like Morrison when their contracts ended after the sixth season.

I felt like filming that would let people know that. That, if there were any questions on the breakup, those would be squashed if they saw the breakup. \u2026 I hope I gave her a little bit of closure.\u201d\n\nABC\n\nKufrin will, in fact, be the next Bachelorette \u2014 a decision that was announced on Tuesday during the live After the Final Rose conclusion to Arie Luyendyk Jr.\u2018s season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy for her,\u201d Luyendyk Jr., who is now engaged to Burnham, said of the decision on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m happy that she\u2019s going to be able to find her true love through the show.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis ending obviously wasn\u2019t perfect.

The Dolby Theatre in Hollywood is a well-known venue that hosts various high-profile events, including the Academy Awards.\n\nThe only aspect that raises some skepticism is Julia Roberts' absence from the event, but this might be due to scheduling conflicts or other personal reasons, which are common occurrences in the lives of celebrities.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the message is more likely to be true than not. 1",

After eight years we should have one priority, making sure two incredible kids are loved and remain happy and healthy.\"\n\n\"But every couple of months there is another accusation coming from Brandi in an attempt to drum up drama to stay relevant,\" Cibrian continued. \"LeAnn and I did not, nor have we ever, 'shown up' at places where Brandi will be. Why would we do that? Makes no sense. We had a reservation held at Nobu five days before Brandi posted she was going. Here is the proof and if anyone needs more, call Nobu and they will confirm.

It has the slightly pejorative connotation of something ordinary\u2014the antithesis of the magic and wonder that fabulous design is meant to inspire. Yet, when one enters the Manhattan home of actress Julianne Moore, the first impression is of surprising normality. Teenagers buzz about, doing whatever it is that teenagers do, and dogs bark affectionately for attention. The rooms possess the kind of engaging homeyness that emerges, seemingly without effort, in spaces where someone has paid close attention to proper scale, proportion, and period detail. There is no indoor lap pool, Turkish-style hammam, James Turrell skyspace, or any other conspicuously lavish signifier of luxury. It feels like a home\u2014delightfully, unapologetically normal.\n\n\u201cFor years I dreamed about living in a townhouse in the West Village,\u201d says the Oscar-winning actress, who lights up the big screen this fall with a hat trick of high-profile films: Todd Haynes\u2019s Wonderstruck, George Clooney\u2019s Suburbicon, and Matthew Vaughn\u2019s Kingsman: The Golden Circle. \u201cThe first time I walked into this one, I knew this was it\u2014I fell in love,\u201d Moore recalls. That was 15 years ago. At the time, the five-story house had been carved up into apartments, but the original front-and-back-parlor configuration was intact, as were the floors, shutters, fireplaces, and staircase. \u201cThere was enough character left that we could bring the house back to its Greek Revival roots without destroying the soul and texture of the building,\u201d Moore says.\n\nBottega Veneta black-and-tan butterfly dress; Giavanni Rossi heels; Chopard rings Photo by Alexi Lubomirski\n\nBefore the renovation began, Moore married her longtime partner, writer/director Bart Freundlich, in the garden at the rear of the house. Both of their children\u2014Cal, now 19 and a sophomore in college, and Liv, a 15-year-old high school student\u2014were present for the low-key ceremony, effectively putting the family\u2019s stamp on the property even before the clan moved in. In fact, the renovation itself was something of a family affair, orchestrated by Bart\u2019s architect brother, Oliver Freundlich, and his then-partners Ben Bischoff and Brian Papa, in collaboration with Moore, a passionate design junkie.\n\nThe makeover lasted a year and a half, after which the actress stocked the house with an enticing array of decorative treasures that evidence a distinct predilection for organic forms, warm materials, and spruce midcentury lines: a George Nakashima cocktail table, lamps by Isamu Noguchi, a Florence Knoll credenza with rattan doors, and a host of un-pedigreed but sympathetic vintage finds. \u201cI like things that have real personality and authenticity,\u201d Moore says. \u201cI hate a knockoff.\u201d",

Paltrow, 45, already shares two children, Apple, 14, and Moses, 12, with her ex-husband, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. However, she\u2019s ready to build a brand new life with Falchuk and the two are reportedly looking into the adoption process.\n\nSources tell the outlet that Gwyneth and Brad were exploring the possibility of IVF to conceive their own biological child, but changed their minds. The insider also claims that the pair seriously considered using a surrogate to have a child, much like Kanye West and Kim Kardashian recently did. However, after much consideration they came to the conclusion that they would like to adopt a child. Paltrow is close to Charlize Theron and Sandra Bullock, both of whom have adopted children, and they\u2019ve given her some very inspiring food for thought when it comes to the process.\n\nHowever, sources tell Gossip Cop that Gwyneth and Brad are not planning to start a family together, the actress is not pregnant nor is she considering adoption at the moment.\n\nMeanwhile, a wedding and a new child aren\u2019t the only things that Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Falchuk are planning together. The couple are reportedly combining many of their assets as their wedding day approaches, and are ready to open a brand new production company together.\n\nLast month, Paltrow and Falchuk threw a star-studded engagement party. Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, Demi Moore, and many more of their family and friends were in attendance at the black tie affair, which some believed could have been their secret wedding. While the couple have not confirmed whether or not they are currently married, some fans believe they may have tied the knot under the radar.\n\nMeanwhile, Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s ex-husband, Chris Martin, has also moved on from their marriage. He has had multiple relationships since the divorce, including one with actress Jennifer Lawrence. However, he is currently dating Fifty Shades of Grey star Dakota Johnson.

And Selena\u2019s case of Lupus seems to be especially severe.\n\nSo, now that she\u2019s being directly interviewed, how does Mandy feel about Selena\u2019s latest reunion with the Biebs?\n\n\"Not happy.\"\n\nThat much, we knew, but it sure would have been interesting if Mandy were pretending that it\u2019s totally fine.\n\n\"Selena can live her life however she wants as long as she is happy, safe, and healthy.\"\n\nThose are some very reasonable caveats.\n\nBut the relationship that she describes having with Selena isn\u2019t exactly the feud that we\u2019ve been hearing about.\n\n\"Every mother and daughter has disagreements.\"\n\nAnd Mandy denies that her relationship with her daughter began to crumble in 2014 when she stopped being Selena\u2019s manager.\n\nWe\u2019d heard reports that Selena\u2019s reunion with Bieber was just one source of conflict.\n\n\"We never expected to manage her her whole life. We lost family time because the only time we saw her, we talked business.\"\n\nWe were going to say that sounds like no fun, but Mandy beat us to it.\n\n\"It was no longer fun for any of us, like it was when she was younger and we had to be with her because she was a minor.\"\n\nMandy sounds determined to quash the feud rumors, saying of Selena:\n\n\"She is 25 years old and knows what is at stake with her health. I do not control her the way it has been portrayed.\"\n\nWell, surely no one really believed that Mandy was somehow giving her adult millionaire celebrity daughter a curfew.\n\n\"Selena is an adult and can make her own choices.\"\n\nThat\u2019s very true. We don\u2019t have to agree with Selena\u2019s choices in order to like her, folks.",

Twenty-two people were killed and more than 800 injured.\n\nGrande said: \u201cMusic is supposed to be the safest thing in the world. I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s still so heavy on my heart every single day. I wish there was more that I could fix. You think with time it\u2019ll become easier to talk about. Or you\u2019ll make peace with it. But every day I wait for that peace to come and it\u2019s still very painful.\u201d\n\nScooter Braun, Grande\u2019s manager, discussed the immediate aftermath of the bombing. Grande had flown back to her grandmother\u2019s house in Florida when he asked her to stage a tribute concert for the victims: \u201cShe looked at me like I was insane. She said, \u2018I can never sing these songs again. I can\u2019t put on these outfits. Don\u2019t put me in this position.\u2019\u201d They cancelled the rest of the tour, but two days later Grande agreed to do the concert, telling Braun: \u201cIf I don\u2019t do something, these people died in vain.\u201d\n\nThe concert, One Love Manchester, was held on 4 June 2017 and featured performers including Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Coldplay and Liam Gallagher. More than 55,000 fans attended. Grande told Time of the importance of staging the concert: \u201cThe last thing I would ever want is for my fans to see something like that happen and think it won.\u201d\n\nThe profile also revealed that Grande and members of her crew got bee tattoos in tribute to the Manchester worker bee, a motif adopted during the Industrial Revolution. A bee appears at the end of the video for No Tears Left to Cry, Grande\u2019s comeback single.\n\nThe singer\u2019s fourth album, Sweetener, is expected to arrive later this summer and feature production from Max Martin, Savan Kotecha and Pharrell Williams.",

But Venit \"continued to leer at Crews, provocatively wagging his tongue again, and then grabbed and squeezed Crews\u2019 genitals again.\" Crews states he asked the nearby Sandler, with whom he had appeared in several films, for help.\n\n\"Sandler shook his head at Venit in disbelief,\" reads the suit, and later called the actor to see if he was OK. The next day, Venit called Crews to apologize, saying he was not himself.\n\nMore:Terry Crews shares story of sexual assault, receives praise from fellow celebs\n\nCrews, a WME client before he formally left the company in mid-November, says he informed his agent at the company the next day, but the agency took little action \"likely because Venit is a significant moneymaker for WME.\"\n\nVenit's client roster includes several Hollywood names who have been accused of harassment, including Sylvester Stallone, Casey Affleck, Brett Ratner and Dustin Hoffman. He also represents Sandler and Eddie Murphy.\n\nList:All of the Hollywood power players accused of sexual assault or harassment\n\nThe suit also alleges that \"WME agents are knowingly permitted and encouraged to engage in sexually predatory conduct in the assertion of their power and clout over persons similarly-situated to Crews.\"\n\nCrews says he suffered actual pain as well as psychological issues.

I hadn\u2019t yet gotten my period and was happily running around a state fair with my best friend, mouth full of cotton candy, when it hit me: a steady drum of pain beneath my pubic bone, a throbbing in my back that made its way down both my legs. I fell to the muddy ground. Suddenly the Ferris wheel was a nightmare, the carnival games distorted and unpleasant. I blacked out.\n\nAt the E.R. they told me it could\u2019ve been a reaction to bad chicken (sure) and sent me home with Pepto-Bismol. Thus began a 15-year routine of pain, questions and nonanswers that would continue until I was found to have endometriosis at age 27. (This delay is not unusual, and the average woman suffers for years before she is given a diagnosis.) My only savior during much of that time? Oral contraception.\n\nImage Lena Dunham in New York City earlier this year. Credit... Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nBirth control pills are many women\u2019s method of choice for preventing unintended pregnancy and should be covered by all insurance policies for that reason alone. But for millions of women living with endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, cystic acne, migraines, uterine abnormalities and a history of ectopic pregnancies, birth control can be a crucial, even lifesaving, medical treatment. While there is no cure for endometriosis, hormonal contraception can control pain and bleeding by stopping or significantly shortening the length of a woman\u2019s period. It helps keep women with the disease happy, healthy and able to work. Considering how little money the government puts into endometriosis research (last year, the National Institutes of Health allocated around $10 million of its $32 billion budget to it), it\u2019s clear that our country already has a dangerous disregard for women with this common condition. But imagine if this disease that affects about one in 10 women of reproductive age were allowed to progress unhindered. Imagine losing these women\u2019s essential contributions to our world because of a treatable illness.",

The site claims that \"the bad boy crooner had a secret rendezvous with ex-wife Miranda Lambert and poured out his heart about how much he missed her.\"\n\nThe same report says \"insiders\" revealed that Shelton and Lambert got \"cozy\" during a gala in Nashville, and that he even complimented her on her new single, \"Vice.\" According to the report, Shelton's current girlfriend Gwen Stefani is not happy about his secret meeting with Lambert.\n\nIn recent days, more than one outlet has published reports claiming that Shelton and Lambert reunited.

Although Shelton and Lambert were both at the ACM Honors in August, they never encountered one another at the event.\n\nWhile Shelton is completely devoted to The Voice right now, Lambert is preparing for the release of a double album.

    "content": "When visiting Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Thursday, Isla Fisher talked about how fans constantly confuse her with actress Amy Adams. Fisher admitted that she usually tries to correct people, but that she sometimes goes along with the assumption.\n\nFor instance, she almost got caught in a lie at the Vanity Fair Oscars afterparty. \u201cThe crowd parted and there was Lady Gaga and she\u2019s heading right toward me and she says, \u2018Thank you. Your performance in American Hustle, Amy\u2026.\u2019\u201d The actress is a big fan of the singer and didn\u2019t want to tell her the truth, so she went along with her presumed identity as Amy Adams. \u201cSo I just gracefully thanked her and bowed my head.\u201d As she continued to fall deeper into the lie, her true identity was almost exposed. \u201cI look over her shoulder and there\u2019s Amy Adams walking into the party.\u201d She quickly created a diversion by pointing to Adams and saying, \u201cThere\u2019s Isla Fisher. She\u2019s not even nominated for anything. What\u2019s she doing here?\u201d\n\nThe actress also recalled a time when a mother and her children spotted Fisher at IKEA and requested that she sing \u201cThat\u2019s How You Know,\u201d a song Adams performs in Enchanted. \u201cI\u2019m tone-deaf,\u201d Fisher prefaced before singing a few lines from the song to Kimmel. After hearing Fisher\u2019s rendition, the woman \u201cbacked away realizing that I was clearly not Amy Adams.\u201d\n\nIn order to avoid any more confusion, Fisher brought a PSA to explain the differences between the two actresses. \u201cI feel as though I should, this evening, set the record straight,\u201d she said while introducing the clip.\n\nThe PSA opens with Fisher standing in front of a white backdrop with a piano playing in the background. \u201cHello. I\u2019m Isla Fisher and I\u2019d like to clear something up,\u201d she began. \u201cI am not Amy Adams. Amy Adams and I are completely different people.\u201d\n\nFisher first explained that she and Amy Adams have different hair colors. \u201cAmy Adams has auburn red [hair]. My hair is light auburn red,\u201d she said. She then pointed out that they have had different roles. \u201cAmy Adams played Susan in Nocturnal Animals. I played Laura in Nocturnal Animals.\u201d\n\nThe actress also explained that they have different accomplishments. \u201cAmy Adams has five Oscar nominations,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a member of SAG.\u201d\n\nAnd Fisher joked that she and Adams might also be confused for another redheaded actress. \u201cAmy Adams played Maya in Zero Dark Thirty. Oh wait, no. That was Jessica Chastain,\u201d she said. \u201cOK, maybe it\u2019s a little hard to tell us apart,\u201d Fisher admitted. \u201cBut the point is when you come up to any of us and say \u2018I love you in Arrival,\u2019 it hurts because we weren\u2019t in Arrival.\u201d\n\nFisher concluded the PSA by stating, \u201cWe have totally different names, hence we are totally different people.\u201d She also wanted to remind everyone that she\u2019s \u201cnot Wendy from the hamburger commercials.\u201d",

We get along very well, it\u2019s just there\u2019s a little something missing and you can\u2019t really pinpoint what it is. That\u2019s just how I feel,\u201d Iaconetti, 30, told former Bachelor star Ben Higgins on Wednesday\u2019s episode of their Ben and Ashley I. Almost Famous Podcast.\n\nWendt affirmed Iaconetti\u2019s feelings, saying, \u201cI feel like that\u2019s normal and I feel like you get those connections all the time where if you take away our outside world and just put Ashley and me on an island together, we\u2019d probably get along really well. And that\u2019s what Vermont was.\u201d\n\nWhen Higgins asked Wendt if he too was \u201cfeeling the lack of spark also\u201d with Iaconetti, he shared, \u201cI\u2019m very hard at giving up on things. And I\u2019m not saying that we gave up on it \u2026 I\u2019m saying I was still ready to come there again. And I know her birthday, I wanted to be there when I had to work and I was planning on coming out as of that week or she was going to come here. I knew we definitely had an uphill battle. I wasn\u2019t 100 percent in yet, but I also knew I wanted to see her again.\u201d\n\nLorenzo Bevilaqua/ABC\n\nHe added: \u201cBut now that a few days have passed and we both kind of collected our thoughts and emotions and stuff, I know she made the right call and I know this is the way it should be.\u201d\n\nFrom Wendt\u2019s perspective, \u201cI feel like I got friend-zoned. Ashley, you friend-zoned me,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m okay. I think the more I process it and the more \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ve kept it kind of to myself. I didn\u2019t want any comments getting out there without us doing this,\u201d he said, referencing the podcast. \u201cI want the best things for Ashley. I just don\u2019t think the spark was fully ignited by the time we had the conversations, but I respect her for at least doing it earlier on. We could have done two or three more trips and then it just would kind of dragged out, so it\u2019s all good. It makes sense.\u201d\n\nDespite the split, Iaconetti said the exes ares on \u201cfriendly terms\u201d and chose to openly speak about the breakup because what she \u201cwanted to prevent was everybody\u2019s personal interpretations and all the social media picking apart.\u201d\n\nWATCH: The \u2018Bachelor Winter Games\u2019 Cast Reveal Behind-the-Scenes Secrets, Biggest Flirt and More\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t want people to make assumptions,\u201d said Iaconetti, who also noted that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want people villainizing [Kevin].\u201d\n\nSince filming wrapped, Iaconetti and Wendt were intentional about making their relationship work \u2014 including \u201ca lot of FaceTime\u201d and phone calls \u2014 despite being long distance.\n\nTo celebrate her 30th birthday last week, Wendt posted a photo of Iaconetti to Instagram with a sweet caption. \u201cShe has so many incredible qualities I\u2019m learning about each day,\u201d he began. \u201cThere is a reason she has so many friends and people around her that love her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the most driven, motivating, and supportive person I know. She motivates me to be more.

    "content": "Kesha continues to show why she is one singer fans can truly connect with. Accompanying the release of her new song, \"Learn To Let Go,\" the 30-year-old wrote a stand-out piece explaining the meaning behind the song for The Huffington Post. In the essay, Kesha says she is learning to let go after everything she has endured in her past. The musician has been extremely open about her struggles, including battling an eating disorder, suffering from depression, and her ongoing lawsuit with music producer Dr. Luke.\n\nAccording to Kesha, \"Learn To Let Go\" has \"become one of [her] mantras over the last few years.\" Her past is something that she refuses to let define who she is now or prevent her from moving forward, especially when it comes to her career. \"You have to learn to let go of those bad feelings and move forward,\" she writes. \"We all have bias based on whatever our own story and life experience has been, but really the only way to truly evolve is to let the past be the past and move forward with an open heart.\"\n\nIt's easy to let people who have wronged you or let the difficulties you have faced \"haunt you forever,\" as Kesha puts it, but why give them that power? \"Learn from your mistakes but don\u2019t dwell on them, and if you feel like someone has wronged you, let that be their problem \u2015 not yours,\" the \"Praying\" singer notes.\n\nIt may be easier said than done to move on from a situation that has influenced your life negatively, but her advice is something that almost anyone could try apply to their own life. It could inspire people to take their lives by the reins and steer them in the direction they've been hoping to.\n\nThat's exactly what I plan to do. I identify with everything Kesha wrote. We have had two very different life experiences, but that doesn't mean I can't find comfort in what she's saying.\n\nWhen I first lost my 16-year-old brother in a car accident 18 years ago, it was traumatic, to say the least. To make matters worse, there were some family and friends who chose to treat me and my family in unsympathetic ways that were even cruel at times. In most ways, we've managed to move forward with our lives and put much of the toxicity behind us. However, I would be lying if I said it doesn't affect us in a small way today. Letting go of the past completely is tough, but after hearing Kesha express herself in such a light and free way makes me want to cut even that extremely small portion of negativity out of my life for good.\n\nShe truly has a way with words \u2014 even when she's not singing.\n\nIn another part of Kesha's essay, she shares that looking back on her childhood has greatly impacted her life. It's something she also incorporated into her \"Learn To Let Go\" video by including home videos of herself as a little girl. \"It\u2019s this idea of reconnecting to my child-like self because that\u2019s when you are so full of wonder and joy,\" the Rainbow artist explains. \"You can choose to learn from the bullsh*t along the way but not dwell on it and instead connect with that joyful childhood innocence.\"\n\nWho would've ever thought that looking to your childhood might be able to help you out of a rut? It really does make sense, and is an interesting technique that could push you to a more carefree space.\n\nOf course, pain isn't something that goes away overnight. Sometimes you have to work at being happy, which is absolutely OK. And when you have someone like Kesha who opens up about her dark days, but then also shows you how to learn from and let go of the darkness at the same time, well, it's a beautiful thing.",

    "content": "The dust has finally begun to settle following the intense events of Avengers: Infinity War, leaving fans wondering about the future of Earth's Mightiest Heroes. With the next film the last he's officially signed up for, is Chris Hemsworth done playing Thor after Avengers 4, or will the God Of Thunder strike again in the Marvel Comic Universe?\n\nUnlike his brashly confident alter-ego, Hemsworth seems hesitant about picking up the hammer again. Though he's enjoyed working on the films so far, speaking with USA Today he confirmed, \"this is it. I\u2019m done. I won\u2019t be playing the character again.\" Yet moments later he admitted that he and Thor: Ragnarok director Taita Waititi had loads of fun tossing around potential ideas for a fourth Thor film. \"I felt like we re-invented [Thor]. There is a bigger platform now to continue if we want to.\"\n\nAnd yet it's that \"if\" that has fans holding their breath as to whether they'll see Hemsworth onscreen with the Marvel team again. Originally, the actor signed on for a total of four films, with the as-yet untitled Avengers 4 the last he's both contractually obliged to make and confirmed for. MCU mastermind Kevin Feige only adds to the uncertainty, playing coy in an interview with Observer. \"With Infinity War, it\u2019s coming to a climax... and with Untitled Avengers a year later, bringing what will be that first 22 movie arc to a finality,\" Feige confirmed, before adding, \"those stories will continue. I think they\u2019ll continue in surprisingly different and unexpected ways after these two Avengers films\u2026\u201d\n\nFeige is quick to knock the idea that finality equals death; if the storytelling's anything like the comics the Marvel films are based on, some characters bow off stage for a while, only to rejoin the fray when there's a compelling reason to bring them back. Continuing with floating thoughts about possibilities for Thor's future, Hemsworth told IGN that when he worked on his franchise's films, \"I was enjoying it but I was like... I felt a little restricted. And after this last experience with Taika, and actually these last two Avengers, I feel like we\u2019ve reinvented the character a number of times...I definitely feel a renewed sense of excitement and enthusiasm, and more so than ever, I think.\"\n\nIt's a bummer that Hemsworth felt a renewed sense of fun about the franchise just as his contract was coming to an end, but at the same time the actor seems to be painfully aware of the stakes of signing up for another round of superhero action. \"I want to be able to take the kids to school. I may even be off all year,\" he said, speaking with The Times. \"My wife and I were talking the other day about how the years are flying by: our daughter is five and a half and the boys are three and a half, and however much time you do have together, it never seems like enough.\"\n\nStill, the lure of playing a god would be a lot to turn down for any mere mortal. In a recent Instagram post, Hemsworth thanked his fans directly in what sounded like a fond farewell. Instead of just shouting audiences out for making Avengers: Infinity War one of the biggest box-office smashes in recent history, the video also featured Hemsworth saying, \"Thank you so much, everyone who continues to support these characters and the Marvel Universe. We're going to keep trying to crank them out for you, if you let us.\"\n\nDoes that include himself as Thor, or is it a general nod to the entire Avengers team? It's unknown, but what's clear is that despite years of playing Thor, Hemsworth still seems unsure of how he feels about portraying the hero on-screen. The fact that the actor's films outside the Marvel Universe have done less than stellar at the box office makes the God of Thunder, for better or worse, the defining role of Hemsworth's career; it's a solid reason for him to have mixed feelings about taking on the role again.\n\nSo, it seems, whether fans will get to see Hemsworth as Thor again will depend on the kind of future Marvel filmmakers can come up with for the character, and if it's interesting enough for the actor to deem it worth picking up the hammer once more.",

He expressed enthusiasm and excitement about the character, despite feeling \"restricted\" by his previous commitments. His mention of wanting to take his kids to school and have more time with his family also suggests that he may be open to revisiting the role if it means having a better work-life balance.\n\nOverall, while Hemsworth's initial statement about being done with Thor seems clear-cut, his subsequent comments and actions suggest that he is not entirely ruling out the possibility of playing the character again in some capacity. Therefore, I would predict that Chris Hemsworth will play Thor again, possibly in a future Marvel film or spin-off.\n\n1",

    "content": "Dolores O\u2019Riordan, lead singer of Irish rock band The Cranberries, died suddenly on Monday. She was 46.\n\nO\u2019Riordan died in London, where she was recording, publicist Lindsey Holmes said.\n\n\u201cNo further details are available at this time,\u201d said Holmes, adding that the singer\u2019s family was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the news.\n\nThe official Cranberries Twitter account posted a note from bandmates Noel and Mike Hogan and Fergal Lawler later on Monday: \u201cWe are devastated on the passing of our friend Dolores. She was an extraordinary talent and we feel very privileged to have been part of her life from 1989 when we started the Cranberries. The world has lost a true artist today.\u201d\n\nFormed in Limerick, Ireland, at the end of the 1980s, The Cranberries became international stars in the 1990s with hits including \u201cZombie\u201d and \u201cLinger\u201d that melded alternative rock edge with Celtic-infused pop tunefulness.\n\nIrish President Michael D. Higgins said in a statement that O\u2019Riordan and the band \u201chad an immense influence on rock and pop music in Ireland and internationally.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cTo all those who follow and support Irish music, Irish musicians and the performing arts, her death will be a big loss.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Riordan was The Cranberries\u2019 chief lyricist and co-songwriter, and her powerful, sometimes wailing voice was key to the band\u2019s distinctive sound.\n\nThe group\u2019s 1993 debut album Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We? sold millions of copies and produced the hit single \u201cLinger.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up, No Need to Argue, sold in even greater numbers and contained \u201cZombie,\u201d a howl against Northern Ireland\u2019s turbulence that topped the singles charts in several countries.\n\nThe band released three more studio albums before splitting up in 2003. O\u2019Riordan released a solo album, Are You Listening, in 2007, and another, No Baggage, in 2009.\n\nThe members of The Cranberries subsequently reunited in 2009 and released the album Roses in 2012.\n\nThe group released the acoustic album Something Else last year and had been set to tour Europe and North America. The tour was cut short because O\u2019Riordan was suffering from back problems.\n\nIn 2014, O\u2019Riordan was accused of assaulting three police officers and a flight attendant during a flight from New York to Ireland. She pleaded guilty and was fined 6,000 euros ($6,600).\n\nMedical records given to the court indicated she was mentally ill at the time of the altercation. After her court hearing, O\u2019Riordan urged other people suffering mental illness to seek help.\n\nShe is survived by her ex-husband, former Duran Duran tour manager Don Burton, and their three children.\n\nSeveral of O\u2019Riordan\u2019s fellow musicians and fans paid tribute on Twitter.\n\nI once met Delores O\u2019Riordan when I was 15. She was kind and lovely, I got her autograph on my train ticket and it made my day. She had the most amazing voice and presence. So sorry to hear that she\u2019s passed away today x \u2014 James Corden (@JKCorden) January 15, 2018\n\nNooooo!!

Thoughts are with her family and friends \u2014 Kodaline (@Kodaline) January 15, 2018\n\nthis is horrible news to wake up to. rest in peace dolores. https://t.co/KqPvlIs7r0 \u2014 Diplo (@_diplo_) January 15, 2018\n\nMy first time hearing Dolores O\u2019Riordan\u2019s voice was unforgettable. It threw into question what a voice could sound like in that context of Rock. I\u2019d never heard somebody use their instrument in that way. Shocked and saddened to hear of her passing, thoughts are with her family. \u2014 Hozier (@Hozier) January 15, 2018\n\nSo sad to hear of Dolores O\u2019Riordan passing.

Thompson, 27, is in Boston with the Cavaliers for the NBA playoffs but seemingly arranged for some extravagant flower arrangements, which Khlo\u00e9 showed off on social media.\n\n\u201cKhlo\u00e9 is determined to show that she is happy in Cleveland,\u201d a source tells PEOPLE. \u201cShe\u2019s very stubborn when it comes to her life.

But apparently, things are only getting MORE challenging for her, as InTouch magazine reports the selfie queen\u2019s surrogate doesn\u2019t want her inside the delivery room at all when she gives birth! \u201cThere will be major tension between them in the delivery room,\u201d an insider told the media outlet. \u201cThe surrogate doesn\u2019t even want Kim to be there at this point, but she has no other choice. Everyone is fearful a fight could break out between them!\u201d Click here to see gorgeous pics of celeb baby bumps.\n\nWhy all the hostility? Apparently the surrogate is angry Kim didn\u2019t invite her to the baby shower she threw last month. While Kim claimed she didn\u2019t invite her surrogate to the party because she hadn\u2019t explained to her kids \u2014North West, 4, and Saint West, 2 \u2014 that another woman was carrying their sibling, apparently the REAL reason she didn\u2019t extend an invite was far more selfish. \u201cKim didn\u2019t want her to be the center of attention,\u201d the source told the mag, which reportedly left the woman \u201cfuming.\u201d The negative feelings apparently go both ways though, as Kim doesn\u2019t want the surrogate bonding with her child any more than she already has.\n\n\u201c[Kim] doesn\u2019t want the surrogate to even hold her daughter after she gives birth,\u201d a second source informed the publication. \u201c[She\u2019s] extremely concerned that she won\u2019t bond with the baby because she didn\u2019t carry it.\u201d Apparently Kim\u2019s concerns are very strong too, as she\u2019s reportedly been \u201ccrying on a routine basis because this baby just feels so physically distant from her,\u201d the source explained. On top of that, \u201cShe has been unable to even form a bond with the surrogate.\u201d We have a feeling Kim\u2019s insecurities haven\u2019t been helping the issue either.\n\nThe surrogate is also insisting she give birth in San Diego, which is 120 miles away from Kim and Kanye West\u2018s, 40, home. Kim would prefer to have her deliver in LA at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. However, if the surrogate gets her way, it means Kim and Kanye will have to rush to San Diego at a moment\u2019s notice, which is stressful in itself. \u201cKim can\u2019t stop crying or worrying,\u201d the source said. \u201c\u2026She\u2019s unhappy that things aren\u2019t going her way.\u201d\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 do you think there\u2019s really birthing drama between Kim and her surrogate?

Lauer released a statement to The Washington Post last Wednesday, denying any allegations of coercion and abuse on his part.\n\n\"Well, look, I can't speak to what Matt is doing or why he chose to do it, but I think we're all evolving and changing and we all have to find our place in this world,\" Roker told ET about Lauer choosing to speak out.\n\nRoker also didn't appear to be ruffled when asked how his work life has been affected.\n\n\"My deal is I just do my job and just be thrilled that I'm working with, you know...

She said it in a way that was half casual and playful, and half perturbed. Soon after the Hollywood vet walked to her waiting car.\n\nScroll down for video...\n\nAwkward to say the least: Jennifer Garner was asked on Tuesday outside Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Santa Monica about rumours she's pregnant again to which she answered 'How 'bout that?'\n\nThis is what started it all: On Sunday the Alias vet looked like she had a bit of a bump. But Garner could have just had a big meal or a gust of wind could have gone up the dress\n\nThe camera man asked the question because on Sunday the mother-of-three looked to have a baby bump when walking in LA with a print dress.\n\nGarner could have just had a big meal or a gust of wind could have gone up the dress.\n\nEither way, it does not seem likely that the siren is expecting a fourth child as she appears to not have reconciled with Affleck. TMZ cautioned on Wednesday the two are not back together.\n\nBut other outlets are claiming the longtime twosome have worked things out. The cover of OK! this week is devoted to a story on how Jennifer has taken Ben back after he begged on his knees to give him another chance.\n\nInTouch Weekly claimed 'the divorce is off' as they two plan a second honeymoon in the Turks And Caicos.\n\nGirls night out! The 44-year-old was with a female pal before she was asked the question\n\nThe star looked fresh-faced as she left the Italian eatery with her pals in a casual chic ensemble.\n\nLooking at ease with her pals, the brunette beauty - who is mum to Violet, 10, Seraphina, 7, and Samuel, 4 - strolled through the streets of Santa Monica in a simple navy blue v-neck jumper with eye-catching striped shirt detailing.\n\nFlashing a hint of her bra, the Mother's Day star paired her stylish top with loose fitting jeans that hugged her ankles and flaunted her metallic silver sandals.\n\nBeaming! The ex of Scott Foley sure let the question roll off her as she walked to a waiting SUV\n\nBoasting a healthy glow, Jennifer kept her make-up to a minimum letting her chocolate brown peepers pop while her chestnut locks fell loose onto her shoulders.\n\nJennifer's night out with her girlfriends comes after she filmed her latest commercial for Capital One credit cards in Los Angeles on Tuesday.\n\nThe actress wore a crimson, sleeveless blouse as she walked around the set in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Dallas Buyers Club actress added slim black pants and stylish black heels as she ran through her lines.\n\nBright spot: Jennifer looked stylish in a crimson top as she filmed her new Capital One credit card ad\n\nThe Alias alum appeared to be in good spirits, laughing and joking with crew members during a quick break on set.\n\nJennifer, who is a longtime spokesperson for the finance company, wore her light brunette hair down in soft waves, and accessorized with a gold bangle.\n\nShe added peach blush, eyeliner and dark pink lipstick to her polished look.\n\nLast month, Jennifer marked one year since she and estranged husband Affleck announced they were splitting up after 10 years of marriage.\n\nIt's Batman! Jennifer's estranged husband Ben Affleck waved to fans as he arrived at Comic-Con to chat about Justice League on Saturday\n\nHowever, the pair have remained close, with Batman v Superman star Ben even living in the same home, in order to make the transition easier on their three children.\n\nShe also traveled with the children to London for a few weeks over the summer to spend time as a family while Ben filmed Justice League.\n\nA source told People magazine that Ben and Jen are 'still figuring things out' and still have not filed divorce papers a year after their split.\n\n'Ben still doesn't want the divorce and he might actually get his way,' a friend of Jennifer's said.\n\nThe actress also has a few films in the works, including the film adaptation of bestseller The Tribes of Palos Verdes, and a comedy with Kevin Spacey called Nine Lives.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben was been busy promoting his next Batman outing Justice League at Comic-Con International in San Diego over the weekend.",

    "content": "If \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d enduring \u201c \u201d segment is your cup of tea, then a standalone summer edition will be a welcome respite. If not, \u201cWeekend Update: Summer Edition\u201d is unlikely to seduce you. NBC\u2019s special edition of the faux newscast stretches the segment and adds a commercial break, which that means more than ever its success rests not on the momentum of the evening, the charisma of the host, or the enthusiasm of the studio audience but on the talents and chemistry of anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che. Those two are still grappling with a stilted awkwardness in their \u201cWeekend Update\u201d personas that make them both less engaging than they would otherwise be on their own. But as \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has enjoyed a resurgence in ratings and cultural relevancy, Jost\u2019s and Che\u2019s growing pains have smoothed out into a predictable dynamic.\n\nTonight\u2019s premiere of \u201cWeekend Update: Summer Edition\u201d had the advantage of a ton of Trump-related material to work with and several guest appearances: \u201cSNL\u201d cast member Leslie Jones, featured cast members Mikey Day and Alex Moffat, and alum Bill Hader (in a committed impression as Anthony Scaramucci). Jost\u2019s biggest laugh \u2014 one punctuated with gasps and groans \u2014 came from a remark about how even President Franklin Roosevelt knew when to stand up. Che, meanwhile, found his sweet spot in the midst of a long analogy about how the Statue of Liberty had gotten \u201cbougie\u201d lately, which ended with his exclamation: \u201cBitch, you ain\u2019t China!\u201d\n\nStill, with the news being what it is \u2014 and with so many other shows in the satirical news space \u2014 the humor didn\u2019t quite match up to the material. During the regular season, \u201cWeekend Update\u201d gets a handicap precisely because it is buried in the middle of a 90-minute live sketch show with just one week to throw everything together. On its own, the premiere of the summer edition was a reminder of how sharp and hilarious the political satire game can be elsewhere.\n\nWhere \u201cWeekend Update\u201d can stand out is in its commitment to things that aren\u2019t funny-ish one-liners based on headlines. That\u2019s why Jones\u2019 appearances as a randomly horny version of herself are always so welcome. Oddly, the best joke of the night was Moffat as Eric Trump, aah-ing over a fidget spinner, maybe because it barely had to be written at all: Moffat just stared at it, while Day (as Donald Jr.) spun it for him.\n\nWith the threat of nuclear war in the headlines, it\u2019s nice that \u201cWeekend Update\u201d is around for the summer to add a little more levity to a news cycle that is full of fire and fury. And for fans of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d \u201cWeekend Update: Summer Edition\u201d promises to feature contributions from a number of the show\u2019s key cast members during the next few weeks, providing a nice holdover until the mothership returns for Season 43 in the fall.",

Sunday\u2019s season finale of The Arrangement sees Megan escape and seek revenge on IHM. The episode brought every audience to the edge of their seats. Let us find out more about the season finale of The Arrangement!\n\nThe final episode of the first season of The Arrangement began drastically with Megan (Christine Evangelista) escaping. In the episode, Megan climbs out of the back of the car when the driver of the IHM van is away. However, she then ends up right in the doorsteps of a lady who was involved with the IHM.\n\nWe then saw all the IHM employees taking Megan out and gave her a shot. Megan finds herself among IHM employees and also an unlikely character- Kyle!\n\nWhen asked what he was doing there, Kyle said: \u201cI had no choice, it\u2019s the only way for us to be together\u201d. Megan then willingly takes the serum that Terence gives her which allegedly would open her mind up. As she drank, Megan began remembering the day she confronted her step brother, Evan about sexually assaulting her. After denial, Evan yet again attacked Megan!\n\nMegan broke free by hitting Evan with a bottle of wine. But Megan did not stop at that. She kept on hitting him until Evan finally died!\n\nAs she recalled this, Megan woke up and sobbed as she told Terence that it was not \u201cself-defense, it was payback\u201d! She then began having a positive attitude about IHM and even began participating in its workshops. Or at least that\u2019s what she thought!\n\nMegan then met her best friend, Shaun who was also working at IHM. Megan decided to share things with Shaun who had kept the secret about her past. Megan tells that she has to be truthful and that she \u201cwent through hell to get back to Kyle\u201d. Furthermore, she went on to shockingly reveal that she needed her because she was about to \u201cburn the whole thing down.\u201d\n\nYes, Shocking!\n\nNow, it is obvious that Megan has been faking it all and still has not succumbed to IHM. Let us see where her new attitude will take Megan. We hope there isn\u2019t much danger for Megan in the next season. The viewers are desperate for the second season of The Arrangement!",

People seem to think my Twitter is a fan account for that relationship,\u201d she explained on The Late Late Show with James Corden in November 2017.\n\nShe added at the time: \u201cIt\u2019s just weird because Camila Mendes is a very popular name in Brazil \u2026 but they seem to think I\u2019m just a verified fan account \u2026 I just didn\u2019t even know that was a thing so I don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\nAlthough Camila isn\u2019t close to her namesake, Joey King previously noted that she was on great terms with Jaime King, even though they aren\u2019t related.\n\n\u201cLiterally, her closet is the greatest thing in the world. A lot of people think we\u2019re related too. We\u2019re actually not. But we want to be,\u201d the Kissing Booth star told WWD in August 2016. \u201cWe went out to breakfast or lunch one time and I had on this like vintage dress. It was fine. She had these Chanel overalls on. I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude. Kill me. Get out of that. I look stupid next to you.\u2019 She was like, \u2018What?\u2019 And she had her cute little baby bump. I was like, \u2018Stop. Looking so cute all the time.'\u201d\n\nCamila and Joey join other stars that probably deal with the same exact confusion from their fans.\n\nTake Selena Gomez, for example. She shares a last name with Spanish pop singer Becky G, but they aren\u2019t family members.\n\nWhat about Ross Lynch? He\u2019s got the same surname as Harry Potter star Evanna Lynch \u2014 but no, they\u2019re not siblings either.\n\nAnd Stranger Things star Gaten Matarazzo and The Princess Diaries actress Heather Matarazzo don\u2019t share any genes, contrary to popular belief!\n\nThere are plenty more where that came from!\n\nScroll through our gallery to uncover all the other pairs of celebrities who have the same last name but aren\u2019t related \u2014 and prepare to be shook.\n\nLove J-14?

Many expected for the split rumors to surface online soon after.\n\nInstead, Rihanna reassured her fans by telling them that she is a lioness and her man is the king of the jungle, and they sometimes roar at each other \u2014 especially over the FIFA World Cup.\n\nA source close to the actress said do not fear for her couple because they are at each other\u2019s throats, they break up and get right back together in bed.\n\nThe insider shared: \u201cRihanna and Hassan have an extremely passionate and intense relationship, with a tendency to break-up and make-up fairly frequently. They have a powerful physical connection, and when they fight it can get pretty heated, but then they have crazy good make-up sex, and everything is great between them until they fight again.\u201d\n\nThe family friend continued by explaining: \u201cBoth Rihanna and Hassan suffer from a jealous streak, and as they lead very independent lives, it can cause problems between them a lot.\u201d\n\nThe same insider went on to share that the pair\u2019s complicated schedules contribute to the many fights and breakups.\n\nThe pal confessed: \u201cRihanna really is crazy about Hassan, but it\u2019s hard to see how they can make their relationship work long term unless she is willing to scale back on her career, which isn\u2019t likely to happen.

Stefani wore a white bikini top that she paired with a black sarong and a tan sweater, while Shelton sported a blue trucker hat that matched his board shorts and button-down shirt.\n\nWhile they may have been an unexpected pair when they first started dating, Shelton and Stefani have been going strong for some time now.\n\nBackgrid\n\n\"Gwen really loves Blake for who he is and has never once tried to change him or anything about him.

    "content": "Eyebrows have many capabilities. For those like Cara Delevingne, they can make your career. For those like Kendall Jenner, they can cement your status as a serious model, because only those actually committed to the runway would bleach their brows and become full-on goth for at Marc Jacobs. And, well, as for both celebrities and, you know, normal people? Eyebrows of course also serve the central purpose of subtly and effectively keeping sweat and debris from falling into your eyes, thereby protecting your vision.\n\nBut none of these capabilities, apparently, appeal to Antonio Banderas, who, at the moment, seems to be completely devoid of eyebrows. On Wednesday, the 57-year-old actor stepped out on a red carpet in Madrid without any visible hair on his head. (Okay, he still has his eyelashes, but that\u2019s an oversight we\u2019re quite thankful for.) According to E!, the look is ostensibly part of his getting into character for his starring role as Pablo Picasso in the upcoming National Geographic series Genius: Picasso. Take a closer look at the red carpet, though, and you may start to question this reasoning.\n\nWhat\u2019s that Banderas is standing in front of? A larger-than-life photo of his face in his portrayal of Picasso, in which the artist has eyebrows. We haven\u2019t seen the series yet, so it\u2019s unclear whether the poster is simply a less jarring image of Banderas than that which will appear onscreen, or if the two looks simply show Picasso at different stages of his life, since Banderas had previously shared a photo of himself in the role with plenty of gray hair on his face. When he made a lower-key red-carpet appearance sans eyebrows back in December, it simply seemed likely he was still finishing up filming. That possibility seems much less viable this week, though, with the series\u2019 April 24 premiere date fast approaching.\n\nAntonio Banderas Takes W\u2019s Screen Test:\n\nIn Madrid, the two juxtaposed Banderases certainly did make for an, um, eyebrow-raising red-carpet moment. And if Banderas is simply trying out a new look, we\u2019re completely for that. It may just be that he discovered he actually prefers his onscreen look, or that he\u2019s simply looking for some change. Given his track record of late, which includes studying at the same storied fashion school as Alexander McQueen and creating his own line of candles, Banderas does seem to be quite into trying new things. In any case, it\u2019s certainly a better look than some of the others he\u2019s recently rocked on his Instagram.\n\nRelated: The Ultimate Guide to Enviable Celebrity Eyebrows, From Cara Delevingne to Lily Collins",

    "content": "Is it just us, or is Scott Disick\u2018s girlfriend, Sofia Richie, starting to look more and more like his ex Kourtney Kardashian every day?! Though Sofia is half Kourtney\u2019s age, fans can\u2019t help but notice that the 19-year-old has practically become Kourt\u2019s twin.\n\nTake Sofia\u2019s most recent Instagram post as a prime example. Casually posing next to Scott with her sun-kissed glow, Sofia is rocking a thin pair of black sunglasses, high-waisted jean shorts, a billowy white top, and chic white sandals. If that outfit doesn\u2019t scream Kourtney Kardashian, we don\u2019t know what does! Even her pose is Kardashian-esque.\n\nNaturally, fans spoke up about it. \u201cUh, for a moment I thought that was Kourtney Kardashian,\u201d one fan wrote. \u201c[Sofia Richie] looks as if she\u2019s Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s little girl,\u201d wrote another. Of course, this isn\u2019t the first time Sofia has been caught looking like Kourt. In fact, it all started over the holidays in 2017, after Sofia traded in her golden locks for a dark brunette \u2018do. Keep scrolling for some #twinning side-by-side pics of Scott\u2019s present gal looking just like his past.\n\nIt\u2019s not just their taste in fashion that\u2019s eerily similar \u2014 it\u2019s their mannerisms, too. Just take a glance at one of their countless mirror selfies \u2014 both sans pants, of course!\n\nInstagram\n\nThe two women have no problem flaunting their fabulous figures, whether they\u2019re chilling out at home or rocking a barely-there swimsuit at the beach.\n\nEarlier this year, Sofia wore an itty-bitty bikini while in Mexico with Scott, and Lord Disick himself couldn\u2019t help but show her off, posting several shots of her on Instagram. Unlike Kourtney, Sofia isn\u2019t shy when it comes to packing on the PDA with her man, as an onlooker told E! News, \u201cScott and Sofia went in the hot tub and kissed and made out. Scott gave Sofia a massage and they had their arms wrapped around each other. They are very happy together, always cracking each other up and laughing together.\u201d\n\nThough Sofia may be channeling Kourt\u2019s appearance, their personalities are clearly different. While Scott was constantly partying during his on-off romance with Kourtney, an insider told Life & Style that Sofia has actually managed to tame his bad boy ways. \u201cKourtney is giving Sofia credit for turning Scott into a better man, and more importantly, a better father,\u201d the insider revealed. \u201cShe\u2019s happy that Scott\u2019s priorities have shifted from nightmare party animal to reliable baby daddy.\u201d",

    "content": "Tom Hanks never worked with Harvey Weinstein, but the beloved veteran actor spoke to The New York Times about the disgraced mogul and what the recently uncovered allegations of harassment and assault reveal about Hollywood.\n\nDespite never working with Weinstein, Hanks said of the claims against the Miramax co-founder, including three women telling The New Yorker that Weinstein raped them: \u201cAah, it all just sort of fits, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nWhen asked why Hollywood \u201csheltered\u201d Weinstein despite rumors of his inappropriate behavior, Hanks rejected the excuse, which Weinstein himself made, that his behavior could be considered old-fashioned.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a really good question and isn\u2019t it part and parcel to all of society somehow, that people in power get away with this?\u201d Hanks asked. Further adding, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to rag on Harvey but so obviously something went down there. You can\u2019t buy, \u2018Oh, well, I grew up in the \u201960s and \u201970s and so therefore \u2026\u2019 I did, too.\u201d\n\nHanks emphasized that power in Hollywood can be rather manipulative.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s like, well, what do you want from this position of power? I know all kinds of people that just love hitting on, or making the lives of underlings some degree of miserable, because they can,\u201d the actor said.\n\n\u201cThey think their achievements entitle them,\u201d Hanks said, proceeding to reference a quote about power. \u201cSomebody great said this, either Winston Churchill, Immanuel Kant or Oprah: \u2018When you become rich and powerful, you become more of what you already are,'\u201d Hanks said.\n\nHanks agrees with the quote, saying he supports the negative backlash against the movie mogul.\n\n\u201cI would say, there\u2019s an example of how that\u2019s true. Just because you\u2019re rich and famous and powerful doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t in some ways a big fat ass. Excuse me, take away \u2018fat,'\u201d Hanks said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not, you know, I\u2019m not the first person to say Harvey\u2019s a bit of an ass. Poor Harvey \u2014 I\u2019m not going to say poor Harvey, Jesus. Isn\u2019t it kind of amazing that it took this long? I\u2019m reading it and I\u2019m thinking \u2018You can\u2019t do that to Ashley Judd! Hey, I like her. Don\u2019t do that. That ain\u2019t fair. Not her, come on. Come on!\u201d\n\nHanks also commented on the sexism that continues to exist within Hollywood, referring to the show Mad Men, to which he says \u201chad absolutely no nostalgia or affection for its period.\u201d\n\nThe actor explained, \u201cThose people were screwed up and cruel and mean. And, \u2018Hey, wait, that\u2019s going on today? Shouldn\u2019t we be on this?\u2019 Is it surprising? No. Is it tragic? Yes. And can you believe it\u2019s happening? I can\u2019t quite believe that.\u201d\n\nHanks isn\u2019t the only Hollywood star to comment on the recent Weinstein allegations. The actor joins Meryl Streep, George Clooney, Patricia Arquette, Leonardo DiCaprio, Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Lawrence and others.\n\nThe backlash against Weinstein includes him being suspended by BAFTA, fired from The Weinstein Co. and having his $5 million endowment rejected, intended for USC\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts ability to grant scholarships to female directors. The mogul\u2019s producing credit has also been pulled from TWC\u2019s television shows. And a criminal investigation has been opened by the New York Police Department.",

I'll just speak and dance and go crazy and, you know, turn the music up as the audition tape goes on, and just leave the camera rolling.\n\nWhat did the Duffer brothers say about the audition tape?\n\n[laughs] I love it because they're so casual. I sent off the tape at 11 o'clock that night, Australian time. And then in the morning we had a response saying, the Duffers want to Skype you on Sunday. They were kind of like, \"Hey man. So we saw your tape, and, you know, it caused a bit of a stir at Netflix.\" Apparently it was played in the big board meeting.\n\nSo tell me about your choice to use Duran Duran's \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" and Dexy's Midnight Runners' \"Come On Eileen\" in the tape.\n\nSo the season takes place in Hawkins in 1984 in October, so if I was going to be using any music in this thing, it couldn't have come out after that time.

I get so self-conscious, so it was a nice reprieve from that, to be able to do that at home, during the day, while none of my family was home, and just go for it, to just have that moment of freedom, and be able to show them that I can have that uninhibited freedom.

Is it convention? Is it so other people respect your relationship more? For me, I\u2019m just not quite sure where it fits, especially when it feels so easy to get married, and then there\u2019s like the untangling in terms of the state getting involved.\u201d\n\nThe only immediate benefit Faris could name is that marriage makes people take your relationship more seriously. \u201cThere is the importance of how other people then treat you as a married man as opposed to a man with a girlfriend. I do think it is important how other people respect a relationship\u2014I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a good reason, but it is a small benefit of having that label of being married.\u201d\n\nFaris later talked about the pressure she and Pratt felt being a beloved, popular Hollywood couple\u2014and the internet's reaction of \"love is dead\" after they announced they were separating. \u201cChris and I did talk about [it]. We got, like on the Twitter feed, yes like \u2018Love is dead\u2019 and \u2018relationship goals,'\u201d she started. \u201cI think what we were also guilty of\u2014although we had an unbelievable marriage and we have a great friendship now, we love our son to death, and I\u2019m really proud of that because I\u2019m not sure I did that well the first time [Faris was married before to Ben Indra from 2004-2008]. But I do think we obviously cultivated something, and it was rewarding for a while. It was like \u2018Oh, People seem to think we got all this shit all right.\u2019\u201d\n\nFaris confirmed that \"yes,\" she felt a weird pressure because of her and Pratt's couple fame, especially at the end of their relationship. \"I don\u2019t know if embarrassment [of letting fans down] is quite the right word. Something akin to that. I had a little bit of a childish feeling of \u2018Oh come on, fucking grow up!\u2019 Like, [there was] a little anger. But that\u2019s not fair either, because I cultivated it though,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe intentionally cultivated this idea of like, \u2018Look at this beautiful family.\u2019 There were so many moments that were like that but of course just like anything on social media, you don\u2019t post like, \u2018Where the fuck is the toilet paper?!\u2019 or whatever. I think it\u2019s a very hard forum to be genuine, and I think it does a disservice to people to not be.\"\n\nFaris is currently dating cinematographer Michael Barrett. Pratt and Faris announced their separation in August 2017. \"Anna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating,\" Pratt wrote then. \"We tried hard for a long time, and we\u2019re really disappointed. Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward. We still have love for each other, will always cherish our time together and continue to have the deepest respect for one another.\"",

    "content": "Stepping into the crystal clear waters of the Bahamas for this recent shoot, Kim Kardashian actually panicked for a moment. \u201cSuddenly I thought, \u2018Everyone is staring at me in this bikini,'\u201d she recalls. Of course, it\u2019s hard not to look at the sight of Kim\u2014and her famously curvaceous figure\u2014in little more than a few strips of Lycra. But being the reality star she is, she soon shrugged it off. \u201cI realized I felt good. I wasn\u2019t as insecure as I\u2019ve always been,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable in my own skin.\u201d\n\nBelieve it or not, arriving at this bikini photo op has taken a long time for Kardashian, 28. The second of four children, she recalls bypassing her older sister Kourtney on the puberty fast lane, developing \u201chuge boobs and a butt\u201d by age 11. In 2006 she found fame as Paris Hilton\u2018s BFF and Nick Lachey\u2018s blink-and-you-missed-it love interest. But the spotlight brought a harsh glare: She quickly earned the nickname The Tush from bloggers who scrutinized her weight. \u201cI wasn\u2019t heavy, but I was being criticized left and right,\u201d she says now. \u201cIt really brought me down.\u201d\n\nAs Kim\u2019s stardom grew, thanks in part to the hit E! reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians, her confidence sagged. Despite a shape most women would kill for\u2014with 128 lbs. on her 5\u20193\u2033 frame, she was a size 6, she says\u2014Kim wouldn\u2019t walk on the beach without a cover-up. \u201cI\u2019m most self-conscious about my thighs,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone talks about this great butt I had, but I was so unhappy about it.\u201d\n\nEach year she\u2019d vow, \u201cI will have my perfect body by summer,\u201d but gave up by Memorial Day. Then she opted to be more realistic. \u201cI wanted to be comfortable, fit and toned,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wear Spanx all the time.\u201d\n\nSo, after \u201ccountless\u201d failed attempts at her dream body, Kardashian began daily hour-long workouts in late 2008 and now enlists celebrity trainer Gunnar Peterson (see sidebar). \u201cI\u2019d always work out a day or two but lose motivation,\u201d she says. \u201cI finally realized you have to be consistent. I needed a workout buddy or a trainer to meet.\u201d\n\nShe also began using QuickTrim, a dietary supplement and cleanser that she and younger sister Khlo\u00e9 just launched with GNC. \u201cI needed something to kick loose those last 5 or 10 lbs.,\u201d she says. Recently she reached a trim 113 lbs. and now is a size 2. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s finally all clicked.\u201d\n\nKim also tackled her lifelong love affair with junk food. Instead of eating burgers and fries, she sticks to salads and grilled chicken and limits sweets. \u201cI can\u2019t lose focus,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve worked so hard to get here.\u201d\n\nStill, she says she\u2019s a work in progress. \u201cI love my curves, but let\u2019s be honest: Cellulite isn\u2019t cute. Would I rather not have any? Of course! But I\u2019m proud of my body,\u201d she says. \u201cIf there is something you\u2019re not happy about, you can\u2019t just sit there. You have to put all your effort into fixing it.\u201d\n\nSuch a proactive approach has gotten Kardashian through her public love life. Her marriage of more than three years to music producer Damon Thomas ended in 2003; a few years later a private sex tape she made with R&B singer Ray J, her then-boyfriend, leaked onto the Internet. \u201cNo one should be judged by one mistake,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s how you handle yourself after the mistake. You have to learn from things.\u201d And in July she ended her two-year relationship with NFL running back Reggie Bush, 24. \u201cThat was really hard,\u201d Kim says. \u201cWe both have a lot of love and respect for each other,\u201d hinting that the door might still be open down the line for a reconciliation (in fact, the two were spotted spending time together last month in New Orleans, though they remain split for now). \u201cSometimes people need a break to put things in perspective. Everything was amicable; it just wasn\u2019t working right now. But you never know what will happen.\u201d\n\nThough boyfriendless at the moment, Kardashian doesn\u2019t long for company. Her close-knit clan\u2014sisters Kourtney, 30 (who recently announced that she is having a baby with boyfriend Scott Disick, 26, around Christmas [\u201dI\u2019m so excited to be an auntie,\u201d says Kim. \u201cI will spoil this baby so much\u201d]), and Khlo\u00e9, 25, brother Robert, 22, mom Kris Jenner, 53, stepfather Bruce Jenner, 59, and half sisters Kylie, 12, and Kendall, 13\u2014is never far away and always in touch. \u201cAs many things as I\u2019ve been through, my family has made my life what it is,\u201d says Kim, who also credits her father, Robert Kardashian (the famed O.J. Simpson attorney who died of cancer in 2003) with teaching her to believe in herself. \u201cHis decision to stick up for his friends when everyone told him not to taught me to do what you believe in,\u201d she says.\n\nHaving been raised with such a strong sense of family, she definitely wants one of her own someday. \u201cI want to be married and have four kids. But right now life is moving very fast.\u201d So fast, she barely has time to soak up the sun in the bikini body she worked so hard to flaunt. \u201cI finally feel like I\u2019m in the best shape of my life,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is who I am. And I\u2019m loving it!\u201d\n\nFOR THE LATEST ON KIM, GO TO PEOPLE.COM/KIM_KARDASHIAN",

    "content": "For once, it was Kim Kardashian who was starstruck as she walked into the White House to meet with President Donald Trump earlier this week.\n\nKardashian appeared on CNN Tonight with Don Lemon on Wednesday, where she sat down with Van Jones to talk about her work to get executive clemency for Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old Alabama inmate who was serving life without parole for a first-time, non-violent drug offense. Kardashian's meeting with Trump led to a mixed bag of reactions, with some mocking it as a summit between two reality stars, while others praised the mother of three for making a successful push for meaningful social justice.\n\nTrump granted Johnson clemency and she was released on Wednesday -- a goal Kardashian told Jones that she'd has been working seven months for, contrary to portrayals of the meeting as a flippant stunt.\n\n\"I saw this seven months ago and I have [had] daily phone calls with the White House, maybe a dozen emails a day trying to get letters from the warden,\" she said, though she was quick to credit Johnson's supporters as well. \"I have to get credit to where Alice\u2019s whole team had been working on this for years. I mean, I did step in late in the game. So I don\u2019t want to take away from [that].\u201d\n\nAs for the meeting itself? Kardashian said she was positively floored to find herself in the White House lobbying for something so weighty.\n\n\"I never get starstruck,\" she admitted to Jones. \"I was starstruck over the Oval Office... It really felt powerful, and felt like, you can just feel the history in there... I just took a second to take it all in, and then we talked about it.\"\n\nShe said Trump was compassionate and sympathetic during their meeting.\n\n\"He said, 'You know, this is a really long time that she\u2019s been in here, right? This just isn\u2019t fair,'\" Kardashian recalled. \"He knew that this is the right thing to do, and he said that from the start after he had heard her whole story and situation and he knew it was the right thing to do... And he wanted to make it happen.\u201d\n\nJones asked Kardashian about some celebrities' unwillingness to visit the Trump White House and the possibility that she was being used as a pawn for political game. The reality star answered by saying that she respects celebrity refusals and recognizes the optics of her meeting with Trump. But she said the results were what mattered most.\n\n\"I think Kanye\u2019s already given him legitimacy... you know, in that way,\" she added of husband Kanye West's public support of the controversial commander in chief. \"I don\u2019t think I would be used... And, at the end of the day, he heard me out. We got the job done.\"\n\n\"I just have to stay focused, and I have to know that if [he] is the only person in the world that could have done this for her, why wouldn\u2019t I go talk to that person, if I had the opportunity to? Forget about my fears. Forget about my life. That was the right thing to do,\" she continued. \"I mean, there\u2019s over 3,000 people in this same exact situation as Alice... But it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to stop here.\"\n\nFor more on the famous family, watch the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:",

After bringing back the original version of Flip or Flop, with stars Christina and Tarek El Moussa returning after their divorce, the network just handed out a new series order for Christina.\n\nThe 34-year-old real estate investor has signed a deal to star in Christina on the Coast, an eight-episode design series set to premiere in early 2019. And, unlike everything else on the HGTV roster, the new show will lean a little bit further into the reality TV realm \u2014 highlighting El Moussa\u2019s new life as a single mother and her move from the suburbs to the beach.\n\n\u201cEach episode is going to show a glimpse into a real life, selling my home in Yorba Linda, house-hunting and moving into my new place,\u201d El Moussa tells The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cIt\u2019s going to show me trying to balance it all with kids and work.\u201d\n\nOne of HGTV\u2019s top-rated series at its pinnacle, Flip or Flop was dealt a major blow in 2016 when the central Orange County, California, couple went through a very public split that lingered in the tabloids for months. The network responded with a whopping five spinoffs, each following different house-flippers in different cities, but ultimately got the El Moussas to reunite after their divorce. The reaction among fans has been mixed, with the El Moussas upping the onscreen snark after their separation, but the ratings remain strong. The May 31 premiere, the first new episode to air in almost a full year, netted a strong 2 million viewers and a 0.5 rating among women 18-49.\n\n\u201cChristina\u2019s design style is very popular, so it\u2019s a natural progression for us to expand her visibility with a new series,\u201d HGTV and Food president Allison Page said in a statement. \u201cHer fans also are deeply vested in her personal life and eager to see what happens next \u2014 so we\u2019re bringing them the opportunity to share in these real-life moments in a way that no one else can.\u201d\n\nAlso produced by Flip or Flop maker Pie Town Productions, Christina on the Coast began filming on Monday. Via the shingle and El Moussa, the show is going out to Orange County families in need of remodeling. Each episode will tackle a different family, with a different room of their house that requires El Moussa\u2019s design intervention. \u201cI\u2019m just helping them do one room because of the time constraints,\u201d adds El Moussa, who still has to juggling her new obligations with potential future Flip or Flop production.\n\nAs for the show that made her a HGTV name, El Moussa says she\u2019s pleased with the way the divorce episodes have turned out. \u201cI\u2019m glad we made the decision to continue the show,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was best for everyone.

    "content": "Home Entertainment Jennifer Aniston vs. Anti-Trump Celebrities: Is 'Friends' Star Going After POTUS Critics?\n\nHas Jennifer Aniston been going after anti-Trump celebrities? Reports stated that the \"Friends\" star allegedly slammed Celine Dion for her remarks against America and President Donald Trump.\n\nDion, a Canadian, supposedly made a comment that she's done performing in the United States while Trump is president. She also allegedly insulted the American flag and exclaimed that she hates the country because of its poor governance, according to the printed tabloid Daily News for American.\n\nThe report also cited that Aniston took issues with Dion's comments and attacked the singer. Gossip Cop, however, debunked the publication's claims as the actual report had no concrete proof that the stars said any statements, either for or against President Trump and America. The baseless story ran without confirmations from both stars' camps.\n\nThis was not the first instance that Aniston reportedly spoke against celebrities criticizing the President of the United States. A publication called Conservative Society cited that Aniston planned on building a Celebrities for Trump group to challenge anti-Trump stars.\n\nThe fact-checking site Snopes, however, debunked the claim that Aniston wants to rally up her celebrity friends who are Trump supporters. Like the Aniston vs. Dion tabloid report, the publication did not show concrete proof to back up its story. The site did not conduct actual interviews and the general gist of the report was actually about a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch and not the Celebrities for Trump group.\n\nIs Aniston, however, a Trump supporter? The \"Friends\" star isn't as politically vocal as other celebrities in public but she had a photo taken with Hillary Clinton at the height of her presidential campaign in 2016.\n\nThe actress' best friend, Jennifer Meyer, posted the image on her Instagram with the caption, \"We're with her.\" It was taken during a fundraiser for Clinton that Aniston and Meyer organized along with pals like Tobey Maguire, Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake.",

That anger wasn't sexy or sustainable. That our hearts were still broken from trying so hard to fix it but no longer uncertain about whether or not we could. The finality nearly killed me, and I remember muttering, \u2018But what if we still went on dates?' He laughed sadly. \u2018Whatever you want.'\"\n\nDunham said that she and Antonoff decided that he would stay in their apartment while she would temporarily move in with her parents. It wasn't until months later that she finally got her own place. The actress revealed that though she \"used to love solitude,\" after her first relationship in college, \"the independence I had so prized was replaced with a mourning that could be sated only by consistent male company.\"\n\nIt wasn't until a friend expressed concern over going out to dinner alone that Dunham realized that she hadn't eaten by herself in ages. \"For an exquisite moment, rather than mourn the loss of my partner, I mourned the loss of my bravery. I used to have no problem staring into the face of the hostess when I said, \u2018Just one for dinner, thank you,'\" she said.\n\nEventually, the 31-year-old tested herself by taking baths, reading books, taking herself out to a restaurant and finally taking a walk alone in the country. She learned to \"tolerate herself,\" but also mentioned a possible new relationship.\n\n\"Someone would be coming over soon, the electric current of new romance in the air,\" she wrote. \"But I was still defining myself by what I had lost.\" Dunham then came up with things she liked to do alone, with a few ground rules: \"Do not mention work, work dinners, or masturbation.\"\n\n\"[I'd say] \u2018I'm good, just chugging along,'\" she revealed of what she'd say when friends checked in on her. \"But if I were being honest I'd answer them by saying that my heart could still ache for one home as I returned to myself in another.\"\n\nSee more on Dunham in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:",

And, like most pop star-on-pop star feuds which appear to exist solely in the minds of fans, it\u2019s the type of thing that the two are constantly having to deny. Twice this week Jennifer Lopez has had to address it and, twice this week, Lopez has denied it.\n\nSo here\u2019s how the whole thing went down.\n\nThe Beginnings\n\nIn the early \u201800s, Mariah Carey was doing an interview with a foreign TV station in which she was asked her opinion about several pop stars. She called Beyonc\u00e9 \u201cnice\u201d and \u201ca good writer\u201d and then she was asked about Jennifer Lopez. \u201cI don\u2019t know her,\u201d Mariah Carey said. And, immediately, a meme was born.\n\nIf you\u2019ve not seen the GIF, you\u2019ve probably not spent a lot of time on the web.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nIt is years later; \u201cI don\u2019t know her\u201d has become perhaps the most iconic words to come out of Mariah Carey\u2019s mouth since \u201call I want for Christmas is you.\u201d It was Andy Cohen, in 2014, who was the first to ask J.Lo directly about the shade of it all.\n\n\u201cI know from back in the day, I\u2019ve read things that she\u2019s said about me that were not the greatest, but we have never met,\u201d Lopez, who is no amateur at delivering a verbal knockout, said. \u201cLike, we don\u2019t know each other. I think it\u2019s kind of from word of mouth of things that have happened in the past that I\u2019m not really aware of.\u201d\n\nThen, last year, Carey was doing an interview with The Cut in which she was asked about gifts she receives from her army of fans, the \u201cLambs.\u201d\n\nRecently? I don\u2019t know. [yawns] I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m having a \u201csleep\u201d moment\u2026\n\nWell, there was a very interesting shirt that a fan made with a quote that I said years ago that, when I said it, I really wasn\u2019t trying to be funny. I was just being honest and everybody\u2019s kind of blowing it out of proportion but this guy had a shirt on and it was a picture of me that he made and the quote was underneath it \u2014 and I\u2019m going to leave you hanging as to what it was.\n\nTo recap: Carey yawns before she explains she was \u201cjust being honest.\u201d The word shade is thrown around hyperbolically these days, but true shade doesn\u2019t really sound like an insult. However, the recipient knows. Mariah Carey is one of the masters of the art.\n\nRound Two\n\nTalk of the feud picked up after last year\u2019s Billboard Music Awards, at which Lopez was caught checking Instagram during Carey\u2019s performance. Video of Lopez idly scrolling through her feed immediately became Lopez\u2019s visual response to Carey\u2019s \u201cI don\u2019t know her\u201d GIF.\n\nWhich Brings Us to This Week\u2026\n\nJennifer Lopez is currently on a media blitz promoting the staggering number of projects \u2014 Shades of Blue, American Idol, The Fosters, etc. \u2014 she\u2019s currently working on. Her first stop was Watch What Happens Live where, again, Andy Cohen asked about Mariah Carey.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, that was not fair with the texting thing because I watched a lot of it \u2014 it was a long performance,\u201c Lopez said, in what is not not shade. \u201cI watched most of it, I may have looked down for one second and people were like, \u2018Look at her! Look at her!\u2019\u201d\n\nLopez then booked it over to The Wendy Williams Show where she was talking about her Vegas residency, saying she saw all the shows currently on before she signed her deal, except for Mariah Carey because Carey\u2019s show didn\u2019t start until Lopez was already back in New York to film Shades of Blue. Williams saw her chance and took it with the gusto of a bird of prey.\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d the talk show host joked of Carey. \u201cNo, I\u2019m playing because that\u2019s what Mariah said about Jennifer one time.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe does say that,\u201d Lopez responded, before delivering her magnum opus. \u201cShe\u2019s forgetful I guess.\u201d\n\n",

Some of the stories might have a nugget of truth hidden in them, but most are just so out there that they couldn\u2019t possible have any merit, right?\n\nThe most recent rumor says that Grande forces her staff to carry her like a baby, according to In Touch magazine. \u201cHer new rule is that she has to be carried \u2014 literally like a baby \u2014 when she doesn\u2019t feel like walking,\u201d a source told the magazine. \u201cShe says she doesn\u2019t want her precious feet to hit the floor.\u201d\n\nMore: 11 Times Ariana Grande tried really hard to be Mariah Carey\n\nHere are some other outlandish rumors about Grande that have popped up.\n\n1. She refused to do the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge\n\nAccording to Star magazine, Grande would not film herself having ice dumped over her head because she refuses to be seen without her hair extensions or full makeup. \u201cCelebrities all over the world are doing it for a good cause, but she doesn\u2019t care,\u201d Star says a source told them. \u201cHer skin is a big problem for her and she absolutely does not want to be seen barefaced.\u201d\n\n2. She threatens lighting crews with drastic measures if they mess up\n\nIn August, Grande allegedly berated a lighting crew and made sure she was only shot from certain angles. \u201cShe was a total nightmare,\u201d a source told Star. \u201cShe demanded to be shot only on her left side and told the lighting crew that if they used red light, she would \u2018kill herself.'\u201d\n\nMore: Harsh! Did Bette Midler just call Ariana Grande a \u2018whore\u2019?\n\n3. She has an assistant feed her water with a straw\n\n\u201cShe had an assistant follow her around with a bottle of water and a straw,\u201d a witness told Star. \u201cAnd as soon as she was feeling a bit parched, she would scream \u2018Water!\u2019 and the girl would scurry over\u2026 At one point, the water was too warm for her liking, so she spit it out!\u201d\n\n4. She elbowed Giuliana Rancic in the side\n\nGrande allegedly strong-armed Rancic into moving out of her way during an interview, again to make sure she was only seen from her good side. It seems that this rumor might actually be true, because the allegations come straight from Rancic\u2019s mouth. \u201cI remember, I think I was at the AMAs, she came up on the platform and normally I stand on this side to the camera,\u201d Rancic said, according to Perez Hilton. \u201cLittle Ariana comes over like all bink [mimics an elbow jab] with an elbow in my side. I\u2019m like, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 And they pushed me to the other side.\u201d\n\n5. She wished death upon her fans\n\nAccording to a source, Grande was all smiles while signing autographs for fans earlier this year, but said some pretty brutal things as soon as they were out of earshot. \u201cAs soon as the doors [of an elevator] shut she said, \u2018I hope they all f***ing die,'\u201d an insider told the New York Daily News.\n\n6. She ordered her security to delete a fan\u2019s camera photos\n\nA couple of very disappointed fans took to Twitter after meeting Grande, who was alleged very distant and snubbed them at a meet and greet.\n\nWe won a #MTV contest to meet @ArianaGrande & we ended up in tears. Disappointed our idol would treat us like this \ud83d\ude14 pic.twitter.com/afeb7irAJv \u2014 Jennifer O'Connor (@HerNamesJen) August 24, 2014\n\n@ArianaGrande My sister & I were huge fans. u made @HerNamesJen extremely sad by walking away from her & telling me to delete all my pics. \u2014 Kelle Jansky (@KelleJansky) August 26, 2014\n\nWhat do you think?

NBC has long said the decision was based on ratings, and the network declined to comment on Wednesday. But fans and journalists like then-New York Times media critic Brian Stelter, who detailed the tension between Lauer and Curry in his 2013 book \u201cTop of the Morning,\u201d believe Lauer had something to do with her departure.\n\nIn an interview on CBS This Morning on Wednesday, co-anchor Gayle King said to Curry, \u201cIt was viewed that a very powerful man, meaning Matt Lauer, derailed your career.\u201d Curry \u2014 after joking, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to start crying\u201d \u2014 responded, \u201cYou should ask someone else, I\u2019m not the one to ask about that \u2026 I don\u2019t know what was all behind it. I do know that it hurt like hell.\u201d\n\nAsked if she thought Lauer \u2013 who was fired in November over claims of sexual misconduct \u2013 abused his power, Curry said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to do no harm in these conversations. I can tell you that I am not surprised by the allegations.\u201d\n\nWhen King asked Curry whether she \u201cheard things\u201d or \u201cknew things\u201d while she was at NBC, Curry responded: \u201cI\u2019m trying not to hurt people and I know what it\u2019s like to be publicly humiliated. I never did anything wrong to be publicly humiliated, and I don\u2019t want to cause that kind of pain to somebody else.\n\n\u201cBut I can say that I, because you\u2019re asking me a very direct question, I would be surprised if many women did not understand that there was a climate of verbal harassment that existed.\u201d\n\nAfter Lauer\u2019s firing, some of Curry\u2019s fans took to social media to speculate how she felt about the news. The meme \u201cSomewhere Ann Curry\u201d imagined the former co-anchor greeting the news in various ways, for instance, \u201cSomewhere Ann Curry is breaking out that champagne.\u201d\n\nCurry told People this week that she didn\u2019t revel in Lauer\u2019s firing at all. Instead, she said: \u201cI wish I could say that I was celebrating. But actually I immediately checked myself. Because I knew women had suffered.\u201d",

However, this information can be verified through other news sources and official records, making it more likely that the article is based on factual events.\n\n1",

    "content": "The Real Reason Jennifer Aniston And Justin Theroux Split\n\nIn news that shocked the world and left pretty much all of us believing that love is dead, Hollywood power couple Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced that their marriage was ending in February 2018. The estranged duo issued a joint statement to the The Associated Press that said, in part: \"Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else's fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.\"\n\nThe superstars didn't have much more to say about the matter publicly, though Theroux did crack the door open a bit later that year. However, questions abound about the dynamics between the pair. Aniston and Theroux reportedly got together in 2011, got engaged in 2012, and got married in 2015. Everything seemed peachy keen from the outside, so what the heck happened to this seemingly happy husband and wife? Let's explore some of the potential reasons these two went their separate ways.",

For most of that day, I was morbid,' he said.\n\n'And then I had to psych myself up: drink a couple of Red Bulls, hang out with positive people and then, like, tell myself: 'I have all these people depending on me.

    "content": "Whether you have the honor of being a bridesmaid in someone's wedding or you're a close friend or family member of a bride-to-be, it's likely that you have a bachelorette party in the near future. While it's by far the most fun and celebratory element of the bridal party\u2019s duties, it can also be one of the priciest wedding events. Even if you\u2019re not planning a destination bachelorette party (and thereby skipping flights, hotels, and car rentals), the cost of planning can still add up when you throw in dinners, drinks, transportation, and d\u00e9cor. So, who foots this ever-growing bill? Here, we break down who pays for what at a bachelorette party.\n\nTraditionally, the only person who doesn\u2019t pay for the majority of the bachelorette party costs is the bride. This especially rings true when the bash is an in-town celebration (consisting of a single night out)\u2014as opposed to a weekend away, which is where things get a little more nuanced; more on that shortly. The bridesmaids and other guests will often chip in to cover the bride\u2019s share of the single evening, as well as covering their own costs. That\u2019s one upside to heading out on the town with a bigger group. Of course, this depends heavily on the wishes of the bride and the group as a whole.\n\nDon't shy away from communication while planning the bachelorette party! In order to ensure that everyone is on the same page, have honest conversations with the group as a whole, as well as the bride, to ensure that everyone understands the expectations (and limitations) for the evening or trip.\n\nFor destination bachelorettes, however, that bridal-party-pays-for-everything rule doesn\u2019t apply. Since travel and lodging are involved, in addition to multiple meals out and planned activities, the bride should also contribute to help cover the expenses\u2014especially her own travel and share of the lodging. The bridal party might all decide together to treat the bride to fun decorations for the Airbnb or hotel, as well as one big night out on the town (covering her food and drinks), but she should consider taking out her wallet to cover that hangover brunch the next day.\n\nWhile you\u2019re still in the planning stages, keep the bride in the loop so she, and all of the attendees, have an idea of how much they\u2019ll be expected to spend. Keep in mind that everyone participating in the bachelorette party festivities should be comfortable with the costs of attendance; plan to consult with the entire group about spending before creating the budget. Usually, the most effective way is to ask them individually as group settings could influence each person's response.\n\nOnce a budget has been established that more-or-less satisfies everyone, you can start scouting locations and brainstorming activities that will adhere to that guideline. Consider Airbnb over a pricey hotel suite, and look at options in a few price ranges to find something that works for everyone. As you\u2019re planning activities and meals, be sure to share pricing information from restaurant menus and local activity websites so the guests can start budgeting.\n\nMake pricier activities (like a massage at a high-end spa) optional, and fill in-between time with low-cost or free choices (like a local hike or an afternoon of window shopping) that everyone can participate in.\n\nIf the bride is strapped for cash (hey, weddings are expensive), scrap that weekend in Vegas in favor of something she\u2019ll be more comfortable with. A movie night with her favorite romcoms, quirky games, and junk food (plus the bride\u2019s favorite wine or cocktail) is just as fun and will be much easier on everyone\u2019s wallets. Alternatively, you could sign up for a group cooking class, go see a local concert, or just do a low-key wine and paint night.",

They even got a little cozy in the surf as Swift rode on Alwyn's back through the idyllic blue waters.\n\nSBMF / BACKGRID\n\nThe pair's cozy ocean romp was a rare public outing for the couple. Despite being romantically linked since last May, they've only been spotted out and about together a handful of times.\n\nWhile the lovebirds enjoyed the quiet, romantic holiday in relative privacy, fans of the pop icon were left wondering if this marked the end of Swift's Fourth of July party tradition.\n\nFor years now, the singer and her squad of besties -- which included super models, singers, actress and social media stars -- all gathered at Swift's Rhode Island estate for FOMO-inducing festivities that included barbecues, fireworks, patriotic inflatable bouncy houses and more.\n\nHowever, amid her prolonged break from the public eye in the months before Reputation's release in November -- as well as her highly publicized feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, and taking heat for not being as vocal against President Donald Trump as some fans would have liked -- Swift also skipped last year's Fourth of July celebration.\n\nAs some fans have suggested, it's possible Swift -- like many celebrities -- simply hasn't felt like celebrating the patriotic holiday. Or maybe its because she has been gearing up for and then subsequently performing in her massive Reputation Stadium Tour, and simply hasn't had time or energy to throw together a massive party. Only Swift herself can answer those questions.\n\nFor more on Swift's epic Fourth of July celebrations of years' past, check out the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:",

It hurt me that I hurt other people\u2026. I\u2019ve been yelled at before, stepped in controversy before, but nothing to that extent. You can never really prepare for something like that.\u201d But she has learned, as \u201ca huge people pleaser,\u201d to be more aware of goings on on set, where, she said, \u201cI need to be more present and pay more attention.\u201d\n\nOne thing Jenner isn\u2019t mincing her words over is whether she\u2019ll be joining her sisters in their very contemporaneous pregnancies. \u201cI am ready to wait,\u201d she clarifies, having just bought a new home and forming plans to maybe begin competing as an equestrian under an androgynous alias. \u201cI want to have kids, but at, like, 28 or 29.\u201d",

He was imprisoned in 2008 for armed robbery.\n\nNeither Justin nor his older sister decided to show up for their father's parole hearing in Nevada on Thursday.\n\nTheir older half-sister Arnelle did show up and spoke in favor of him being released. Arnelle's brother Jason did not appear.\n\nDuring the hearing, an upbeat OJ, now 70, revealed plans to move back to Florida upon his release. He may be freed as soon as October.\n\nHe spoke about Justin and his sister, telling the Nevada parole board when asked why he wanted to be freed: 'I have four kids. I've missed a lot of time with those kids.\n\n'I\u2019ve done my time.'\n\nArnelle, OJ's daughter with his first wife, Marguerite Whitley, read aloud an emotional letter which helped secure her father's release.\n\n'Thank you.

    "content": "This post contains spoilers for Stranger Things 2.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering throughout the second season of Stranger Things whether Noah Schnapp, who plays the once-missing \u201czombie boy\u201d Will Byers, ever lost his voice from all that screaming, the answer is a definite \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nWill spent most of the Netflix drama\u2019s first season lost in the Upside Down. But this time around, he\u2019s got a lot more screen time: he\u2019s back in school, where bullies make fun of him; he keeps having terrifying \u201cepisodes\u201d that expose him to the shadowy realm that co-exists with his sleepy Indiana hometown; and, perhaps most importantly, he\u2019s got to decide how he feels about his prospective stepdad, played by none other than nerd royalty Sean Astin. Though this season holds many great surprises, one of its best is the skill and sensitivity with which Schnapp plays Will\u2014turning what could have been a flat scream-fest into something more deeply resonant. At times, staring into Will\u2019s wide, terrified eyes, it\u2019s hard not to feel his isolation and terror.\n\nIn an interview with V.F., Schnapp outlined tackling some of this season\u2019s greatest challenges\u2014including, yes, losing his voice for three days from screaming so much in the finale.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the massive success of Season 1 made the experience of filming Season 2 a little different. Security was beefed up: the cast\u2019s scripts had to be \u201call rounded up and given to this one guy, so he could burn it or something,\u201d according to Schnapp. And, yes, there were several meetings outlining what the cast could and could not discuss publicly\u2014though plenty of people have still tried to coax spoilers out of the actor. \u201cThey\u2019ll say it like, \u2018So I know this is happening. Can you just confirm it?\u2019 . . . People are very sneaky, but we\u2019ve been drilled in not to say anything.\u201d\n\nThe biggest challenge for Schnapp is one of relatability: \u201cI\u2019ve never been stuck in the Upside Down, and no one else I know has, so it was kind of something new to just create,\u201d Schnapp said. His inspirations? Schnapp read stories and myths about people who had been possessed, then did his best to put himself in Will\u2019s shoes. We won\u2019t spoil the finale, but Will does spend one particularly harrowing scene screaming his lungs out. Although the Duffers initially instructed Schnapp not to strain his voice\u2014the actual screaming sounds would be edited and added in later\u2014he went for it anyway; as the actor explained, \u201cit felt really weird [to have] my mouth open but not screaming.\u201d Eventually, he paid the price.\n\n\u201cI was screaming and screaming,\u201d Schnapp said. His voice held out for a full day of shooting\u2014\u201dbut then the next morning I woke up, and I just\u2014I\u2019d open my mouth, and nothing came out for the next three days.\u201d\n\nChallenges like this are part of the Stranger Things deal, but it\u2019s also got its perks\u2014like meeting Astin, whom Schnapp described as \u201cso cool.\u201d",

    "content": "Lopez, whose parents came from Puerto Rico, grew up in the Bronx, where she shared a bedroom with her two sisters. She famously left home at 18 to make it as a dancer, and burst on the scene in 1991 as one of the Fly Girls on Fox\u2019s In Living Color, the hit comedy series. She quickly parlayed her luminous beauty, talent, and sheer workaholism into a series of starring roles, including Marisa in Maid in Manhattan, which grossed more than $150 million worldwide.\n\nOf their first date Lopez recalls, \u201cI don\u2019t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date. . . . He was nervous, and it was really cute.\u201d\n\nBeing a movie star wasn\u2019t enough for Lopez. She also released a string of hit albums and became a fashion icon. In 2003, she signed a lucrative endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton. \u201cNow it\u2019s odd if you\u2019re a celebrity and you don\u2019t serve as the spokesperson for a brand,\u201d says Benny Medina, her longtime manager, whom Lopez credits with seeing the potential of celebrities as brands long before it was commonplace. \u201cBut back then there were plenty of snarky comments.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Lopez was granted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and the following year she became the first female artist to receive a Billboard Icon Award; her net worth has been estimated at more than $300 million. \u201cThere are people who put their feet in other people\u2019s footsteps,\u201d says Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, who was once Lopez\u2019s agent and is now a partner in her production company. \u201cJennifer had no footsteps in front of her, so much of the terrain had to be forged.\u201d\n\nThere was a cost, Lopez learned. \u201cWhen you have that type of success at a young age you have to navigate it, almost survive it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the first Latin actress to ever make $1 million from a role, and you feel, Oh God, I have to do something great all the time.\u201d There were the inevitable flops (most prominently Gigli, her movie with then boyfriend Ben Affleck) and three failed marriages, the last of which was with Marc Anthony, the father of her twins.\n\nAnd so her story isn\u2019t just about astounding achievement but also about personal growth and resilience. \u201cI was eviscerated,\u201d she recalls about the press on Gigli. \u201cI lost my sense of self, questioned if I belonged in this business, thought maybe I did suck at everything. And my relationship [with Affleck] self-destructed in front of the entire world. It was a two-year thing for me until I picked myself up again.\u201d\n\nShe has also conquered what was once her biggest fear: being alone. Last August, she broke up with dancer Casper Smart in an effort to learn how. \u201cShe\u2019s a seeker,\u201d says her close friend Leah Remini, the actress and anti-Scientology activist. \u201cShe\u2019s always trying to improve herself, her relationships, be a better friend, a better daughter, a better mother, a better person. She\u2019s not closed-minded.\u201d",

    "content": "There will be no shortage of A-list celebrities attending the Oscars this weekend, but one superstar that won't be in attendance is Kate Winslet. The actress is reportedly skipping the awards show this year, and there's a pretty scandalous reason why if you choose to believe the tabloids.\n\nStar Magazine is reporting that Kate Winslet is staying away from the Oscars to avoid her Titanic costar Leonardo DiCaprio, but GossipCop is calling bullshit on that story. The tabloid claims that Winslet's husband Ned Rocknroll is feuding with DiCaprio after seeing how the actor interacted with his wife at last year's ceremony. After last year's Oscars, Star posted a gallery of images of Winslet and DiCaprio hugging and kissing at the show, and speculated that the former costars may have sparked a romance. The tabloid is claiming that Rocknroll was upset that DiCaprio barely acknowledged him last year and doesn't want to sit through another night where his wife will \"fawn over\" DiCaprio.\n\nOf course, Star is looking for drama anywhere it can find it, and the tabloid debunking site GossipCop is reporting that this rumor of a feud between Leonardo DiCaprio and Ned Rocknroll is pure fantasy. The real reason that Winslet is skipping the Oscars is much less dramatic --- the site says she actually won't be in attendance because she's currently filming her upcoming romance The Mountain Between Us with Idris Elba in Canada.\n\nA work conflict is obviously much more believable than some random feud, especially since Kate Winslet and Ned Rocknroll have been married for a good four years now. The couple met in 2011 on the British Virgin Islands, which are owned by Rocknroll's billionaire uncle Richard Branson. They got engaged and married a year later, and in 2013 had their son Bear Blaze Winslet. Both Winslet and Rocknroll had been married before --- Winslet twice, to directors Jim Threapleton and Sam Mendes, and Rocknroll once, to heiress Eliza Pearson --- and Winslet has two children from her previous marriages.\n\nIf you're wondering what's up with Ned Rocknroll's last name (like I was), it was apparently just a result of him wanting to take life less seriously. The 38-year-old businessman was born with the much less eye-catching last name of Smith, but decided to legally change it to Rocknroll as a reaction against people taking things so seriously, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nAnd if Ned Rocknroll hates seriousness enough to legally change his name, it sure leads me to believe that he wouldn't get too wrapped up in a petty celebrity feud. Kate Winslet isn't up for any awards at this years Oscars, so she probably isn't too upset to be working on her movie this weekend instead of attending.",

This is because Star Magazine is known for sensationalizing celebrity news and creating drama where there may not be any, whereas GossipCop has a reputation for fact-checking and debunking false rumors.

He's been Williams' biggest champion as she returned to tennis this year and made it all the way to the Wimbledon final earlier this summer.\n\nHe's also melted the internet with his modern take on successful women, what it means to be a supportive partner and more.\n\nIn an interview with \"GMA\" earlier this year, Ohanian said, \"There's probably a lot of guys who would feel threatened in a situation with a partner who is extremely talented and successful. It seems kind of absurd to me, though, because all of that success and all of that greatness is something that you should be championing.\"\n\nAnd when it comes to the other lady in his life, his little Olympia, well he's your typical proud dad. So much so, that he and Serena have created an Insta account for her.\n\nAnd though they spoil their little girl each and every day with love and support, Williams explained last week why there would be no birthday party for Olympia.\n\nDuring a press conference for the U.S. Open, Williams revealed that \"Olympia doesn\u2019t celebrate birthdays. We\u2019re Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, so we don\u2019t do that,\" according to People magazine.\n\nThough Olympia didn't get a party, Williams has been a bastion of hope for all working and non-working mothers -- not only returning to and creating real change in tennis and the rules on how it handles motherhood -- but also posting about everyday motherhood and trying to create a supportive dialogue online.\n\nJust last week, Williams wrote, \"Kids humble us. The other day on a flight home Olympia had so much energy and insisted on running up and down the aisle. When I finally got her to calm down and sit still, she threw up all over me and in the aisle. #ThisMama wants to remind all mothers the importance of supporting one another through the highs, lows, laughs and tears. Share your own stories of motherhood with hashtag #ThisMama. I\u2019d love to hear them!\"\n\nThat post garnered half a million likes and thousands of comments from other moms dealing relating to her story.\n\nOnce again, Williams proves she's a champion on and off the court!",

She shot to stardom with her no-holds-barred performance as Dina in the raunchy comedy Girls Trip (2017).\n\nHaddish\u2019s father, who was Eritrean, left the family when she was still a toddler. After her mother suffered brain damage in a car accident, Haddish spent several years in foster care before going to live with her grandmother as a teenager. Her penchant for making her classmates laugh led her social worker to point her toward the Laugh Factory Comedy Camp, a free summer program offered by the comedy club chain Laugh Factory to teach underprivileged children how to perform stand-up comedy. The camp proved to be a transformative experience for Haddish.\n\nBritannica Quiz Pop Culture Quiz\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Haddish focused on forging a career in comedy, using her life as source material. Although she made headway, she earned so little money that at times she was forced to live in her car. Her first big break came in 2006 when she was a contestant on the television comedy competition show Who\u2019s Got Jokes? Two years later she appeared on Def Comedy Jam and the reality-show spoof Reality Bites Back. During this time, Haddish began to be cast in a number of sitcoms, and she also acted in such films as the comedies Meet the Spartans (2008) and The Janky Promoters (2009), which was written by and starred rapper and actor Ice Cube.\n\nHaddish gained a larger audience with recurring roles on the spoof comedy series Real Husbands of Hollywood (2013\u201314), starring Kevin Hart; Tyler Perry\u2019s If Loving You Is Wrong (2014\u201315); and The Carmichael Show (2015\u201317). She became a sought-after guest for talk shows, appearing on Chelsea Lately, hosted by Chelsea Handler; The Tonight Show with Jay Leno; and The Arsenio Hall Show.\n\nIn 2016 Haddish played a street gang member in the comedy Keanu, the feature film debut of comedians Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key. The following year she gave her breakout performance in Girls Trip, in which she costarred with (and stole the show from) Regina Hall, Queen Latifah, and Jada Pinkett Smith.

    "content": "Lots of people take to social media to share photos of their kids, documenting everything from birth to prom and beyond. But this week, Instagram queen Jennifer Garner explained why her kids are off limits on social media. Though she shares everything from the strange contents of her bag to photos from her own childhood, the 13 Going on 30 star has fought to keep her children away from the Hollywood spotlight, and she extends that policy to herself when she makes choices about what to post.\n\nGarner has three children from her relationship with ex-husband Ben Affleck \u2014 Violet, age 12, Seraphina, age 9, and Samuel, age 6 \u2014 and while the paparazzi manage to snap an occasional pic of the family, both Garner and Affleck have refrained from making their kids part of their public lives. While speaking with E! News about her new movie Peppermint, the actress explained that it\u2019s a conscious decision.\n\nIn the recent interview, Garner responded to a question about how she decides what to share on her Instagram account. \u201cWell I would never share my kids,\u201d she told E! News. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty big roadblock right there because if I let myself do that it would be all [waves hands]\u2026 but I\u2019ve fought too hard for their privacy, personally, that it feels weird.\u201d\n\nOther members of her family are fair game though, as seen in photos like this one with her mother:\n\nGarner is far from the first celebrity to shield her children from the paparazzi. Michael Jackson famously had his children wear masks and blankets over their faces when they went out in public. In 2016, his oldest son Prince spoke to the Los Angeles Times about the experience. \u201cMy dad spoke to me like an adult. He told us the reason for the masks was he wanted us to have our own life without him,\u201d he told the Times.\n\nMore recently, celebrities like Halle Berry and Kristen Bell have fought for the privacy of all celebrity children, according to USA Today. In 2013, Berry even helped push through legislation that makes it a crime in California for paparazzi to harass a child, according to HuffPost. Garner even testified at the hearings on the bill, saying \u201cI chose a public life, but my three children are private citizens,\u201d she said, as reported by HuffPost. Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, and Jennifer Lopez are all similarly protective of their children\u2019s privacy both in traditional and social media, according to Marie Claire.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that people like to see their favorite celebrity's kids on social media. It gives you a feeling of getting a sneak peek into the private life of someone famous. Even Garner admits she enjoys it. \u201cI love seeing other people\u2019s [kids],\u201d she told E! News in the same interview.\n\nBut even without sharing photos of her children, Garner has managed to build a successful and beloved Instagram account. Her 1.5 million followers are treated to photo of her workouts, her cute dog, things like her effort to sell Girl Scout cookies, and even at video tribute to her favorite chicken, Regina George.\n\nAll these moments are infused with the enthusiasm and joy that make Garner one of the most relatable celebrities, especially as a mom. So even without sharing her children followers get to feel like they\u2019re truly seeing the actress as herself. Of course social media sharing isn't something limited to celebs, and how to include children is a choice every parent has to make. It's as individual and personal as every decision that come with parenting. But, for those families who do post, it sure is fun to see all those baby pics.\n\nCheck out Romper's new video series, Bearing The Motherload, where disagreeing parents from different sides of an issue sit down with a mediator and talk about how to support (and not judge) each other\u2019s parenting perspectives.

Fast forward a few years and boom, Meghan Markle.\n\nMeanwhile, Bowes's great-grandson Sir George Bowes became a member of parliament during the reign of Charles II and to cut a very long story short, Prince Harry came along.\n\nWhat's more bizarre is the fact that Prince Harry's ancestor, Henry VIII, reportedly executed a relative of Markle.\n\nA new report, via The Sunday Telegraph, claims that back when Henry VIII was reigning in Britain, there was a plot orchestrated by a man named Lord Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford and the great-great-great grandfather to Christopher Hussey (see above), to attempt to overthrow the monarch. As a result, Henry VIII had him beheaded.\n\nNow, before everyone stars yelling 'incest' at Harry and Meghan's shared lineage, we'd like to point out that if you go far back enough to the Middle Ages, you're probably related to the man sitting next to you on the bus or your colleague sat opposite to you.\n\nA genetic survey in 2013 found that all Europeans living today are related to the same set of ancestors who lived 1,000 years ago. And you don't have to go back much further in time to to find that everyone in the world is related to each other.\n\nWho would've though it, ey?\n\nThe news comes days after Channel 4's aired a documentary looking into the Californian star's life, titled When Harry Met Meghan: A Royal Romance.\n\nRelated Story The Weeknd Unfollows Selena Gomez\\'s Friends\n\nRelated Story Things We Learned About Meghan Markle In New Doc",

The whole season was a little bit challenging for me, truthfully. Working so much, I\u2019ve filmed [other] television shows and I\u2019m a mom, which is very important to me, obviously \u2014 and I just cracked at the end of the season,\" she said. \"I\u2019m not used to that either, so it\u2019s a very different, unsettling season for me.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nTinsley addressed speculation that she has come between Carole and Bethenny during an interview with The Daily Dish in April. \"I adore Carole. Obviously she's been such a great friend to me [and] also her taking me under her wing in a sense and wanting to introduce me to Scott [Kluth] \u2014 I'm super appreciative of [that]. But my friendship with Carole is completely separate than anything that's going on with her other friendships,\" she said. \"And, for me, I've only ever known Carole and Bethenny to be super close and they were so tight. And so it's been hard to see their relationship fall apart a bit. But my relationship is totally separate from that. There's nothing that we have to do with the other.\"\n\nIt looks like there's more drama on the way for Bethenny and Carole in next Wednesday night's episode of RHONY at 9/8c.

Lest there be any ambiguity, this statement clarifies my intention and feelings.\u201d\n\nWoody Allen addressed the \u201cvery sad\u201d Harvey Weinstein sexual assault scandal in a new interview where the filmmaker admitted that he was unaware of the severity of the claims against the producer.\n\n\u201cNo one ever came to me or told me horror stories with any real seriousness,\u201d Allen told the BBC. \u201cAnd they wouldn\u2019t, because you are not interested in it. You are interested in making your movie. But you do hear a million fanciful rumors all the time. And some turn out to be true and some, many, are just stories about this actress or that actor.\u201d\n\nThe director and the producer have a long business relationship: Allen-directed films like Mighty Aphrodite and Bullets Over Broadway were distributed through Weinstein\u2019s Miramax, while The Weinstein Company co-produced Allen\u2019s Vicki Christina Barcelona.\n\nMira Sorvino, who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in Mighty Aphrodite, recently opened up about her own experience with Weinstein, an encounter that resulted in \u201cmany sleepless nights.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole Harvey Weinstein thing is very sad for everybody involved,\u201d Allen said. \u201cTragic for the poor women that were involved, sad for Harvey that [his] life is so messed up. There\u2019s no winners in that, it\u2019s just very, very sad and tragic for those poor women that had to go through that.\u201d\n\nTrending Trump Demands MAGA Group Give Him \u2018Millions.\u2019 That\u2019s Not Legal, Experts Say Tom Smothers, a Counterculture Comedy Legend With the Smothers Brothers, Dead at 86 Taylor Swift Fan at Brazil Concert Died of Heat Exhaustion Carla Bruni, Charlotte Rampling Denounce 'Lynching' of Gerard Depardieu\n\nAllen, who has similarly faced allegations of sexual abuse \u2013 including accusations levied by his son Ronan Farrow, who penned the New Yorker\u2018s expose into Weinstein \u2013 also voiced concern that the aftermath of the Weinstein scandal would result in \u201ca witch hunt atmosphere\u201d in Hollywood and beyond.\n\n\u201cYou also don\u2019t want it to lead to a witch hunt atmosphere, a Salem atmosphere, where every guy in an office who winks at a woman is suddenly having to call a lawyer to defend himself.

The deal also extends to the new episodes of Will & Grace, which will be available for streaming on the same platforms the day after their broadcast premiere.\n\nHulu was the logical home for Will & Grace because, as an NBC corporate sibling, it gets access to the network\u2019s current series via the network\u2019s stacking rights. The pact keeps new and library episodes together, as was the case with NBC\u2019s freshman drama series This Is Us, which also went to Hulu in SVOD. Additionally, Hulu has been active in acquiring streaming rights to broadcast comedy series, including the Golden Girls library.\n\nThe original eight seasons of Will & Grace ran from 1998-2006, receiving 83 Emmy nominations and 16 wins, including Outstanding Comedy Series in 2000.\n\n\u201cAs we gear up for the launch of the upcoming season premiere, I can\u2019t think of a better way to reintroduce Will & Grace to the cultural zeitgeist than by giving audiences the opportunity to watch this historic and hilarious series wherever and whenever they want,\u201d said NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt. \u201cWith its witty comebacks, pop-culture references and social commentary, Will & Grace is one of the most binge-able comedies in television history, and I am certain fans both old and new will jump on this opportunity to devour it.\u201d\n\nNBC\n\nThe Will & Grace revival starring Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally already has been picked up for a second season with 13 additional episodes. Both the original and new episodes of Will & Grace are written and executive produced by series creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan, and directed and executive produced by James Burrows.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that Will & Grace has resonated with audiences since the series made its broadcast premiere,\u201d said Hulu, Chief Content Officer Joel Stillerman. \u201cTo be able to bring such an iconic show into the streaming universe for the first time ever is an opportunity we couldn\u2019t pass up.

And it wasn\u2019t just couples who were do-si-do-ing around the ballroom; Monday\u2019s broadcast also featured the first team dances of Season 27, which added a few extra points to each contestant\u2019s score.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s review the highlights of Country Night:\n\nBEST OF THE NIGHT\n\nDeMarcus Ware and pro Lindsay Arnold (Viennese Waltz) \u2014 I was a little stunned that DeMarcus didn\u2019t earn a perfect score after this Viennese waltz, especially given the judges\u2019 praise. For the last three weeks or so, I\u2019ve found his and Lindsay\u2019s performances to be a bit forgettable, which is why Monday\u2019s dance was doubly pleasant to watch. It was so graceful and tender, and DeMarcus seemed more connected to Lindsay and the choreography than he has since the first week of competition. Judges\u2019 Score: 27/30\n\nBEST OF THE NIGHT (RUNNER-UP)\n\nEvanna Lynch and pro Keo Motsepe (Rumba) \u2014 Season 27 has delivered very unpredictable eliminations thus far; Tinashe is gone, but Grocery Store Joe has never even been in jeopardy. (Insert the emoji of the shrugging lady here.) But I\u2019m so glad that voters have given Evanna a chance, allowing her to stick around long enough to really hone her skills and start dancing for herself instead of other people. The Harry Potter actress showcased incredible confidence and sensuality with this rumba, and she seems to have an awareness of her body and the space around her that even some of the strongest contestants lack. Judges\u2019 Score: 30/30\n\nMOST EXHAUSTING (IN A GOOD WAY!)\n\nAlexis Ren and pro Alan Bersten (Samba) \u2014 My goodness, this samba went on forever, didn\u2019t it? Not only was this routine an excellent commercial for Lauren Alaina\u2019s single, \u201cLadies In the \u201990s,\u201d but it also served as a reminder that Alexis could very well win this whole show \u2014 and she would wholly deserve it. Her movements were so crisp, and, somehow, her energy never flagged. (To be fair, her first kiss with Alan was just broadcast to millions of people, so I suspect there was a little more adrenaline pumping for the Instagram model this week.) Judges\u2019 Score: 29/30\n\nMOST OVERLOOKED ERROR\n\nJuan Pablo Di Pace and pro Cheryl Burke (Charleston) \u2014 Let\u2019s not get this twisted: Juan Pablo and Cheryl were really, really strong on Monday, and they\u2019ve been one of the season\u2019s most consistently excellent couples. But. The final eight-count of their Charleston featured a trick that looked so clumsy, I thought Cheryl was about to fall or get forever entangled in Juan Pablo\u2019s limbs. As Juan Pablo put his leg over Cheryl\u2019s body and twisted around her, it seemed the pair got momentarily stuck \u2014 and even if the trick didn\u2019t have disastrous results, it was still an awkward finish to an otherwise electric routine, and I was surprised that none of the judges acknowledged the flub. Judges\u2019 Score: 30/30\n\nThe team dances, meanwhile, shook out like this:\n\n* Team \u201cHay Now\u201d (Bobby, Milo, Evanna and John): 29/30\n\n* Team \u201cJoe-Down\u201d(Joe, Juan Pablo, DeMarcus and Alexis): 26/30\n\nAnd now, the results:\n\nCOUPLES IN JEOPARDY\n\nJohn Schneider and pro Emma Slater\n\nDeMarcus Ware and pro Lindsay Arnold\n\nEvanna Lynch and pro Keo Motsepe\n\nELIMINATED\n\nJohn Schneider and pro Emma Slater\n\nDeMarcus Ware and pro Lindsay Arnold",

After Eminem tore into Donald Trump with a savage freestyle rap, HollywoodLife.com has the EXCLUSIVE scoop on whether or not he\u2019ll \u2018pull a Kanye\u2019 and run for office!\n\nIn a world where a real estate mogul/former reality television star can be elected to the highest office in the land, the idea of Eminem, 44, launching a presidential bid isn\u2019t that farfetched. Some fans were hoping Em (born Marshall Mathers) would declare his candidacy after he lyrically demolished President Donald Trump, 71, at the start of the 2017 BET Hip-Hop Awards. \u201cEminem is very happy that his take down of Trump is getting so much attention,\u201d a source close to the rapper EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. \u201cHe feels that he has to use his gift for good and dropping the rap is his way to get his message out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs for taking it to the political stage and to run for office in any way? Not a chance in the world,\u201d the insider tells HollywoodLife.com, crushing the hopes of anyone wanting an Eminem 2020 campaign sticker. \u201cMarshall is not going to pull a Kanye [West] and announce his candidacy. The nonsense and the baggage that comes with politics, especially running for President would be outrageous.\u201d While Eminem is no stranger to being \u201coutrageous\u201d and causing a controversy or two (especially about Donald Trump), seems politics are just not his jam.\n\nAfter all, why dive into the political world when he could set the rap world on fire? Slim\u2019s freestyle, which he called \u201cThe Storm\u201d on Twitter (per CNN) saw him spit such red-hot lines like, \u201cSame sh*t that he tormented Hillary [Clinton] for and he slandered and does it some more. From his endorsement of [Steve] Bannon, support for the Klansman, tiki torches in hand for the solider that\u2019s black and comes home from Iraq and is still told to go back to Africa.\u201d Damn.\n\n\u201cEminem is a success at music and he wants to use his music for good. And it obviously shows that it is working with this recent attack on Trump,\u201d the insider added. \u201cHe wants to provoke change in the way he knows how, and that is through his music.\u201d So, that takes care of that. If music fans want to see a hip-hop influenced dude from Detroit run for officer, there\u2019s always that rumored Kid Rock, 46, senate run. That\u2019s\u2026something, right?\n\nDo you think Eminem should reconsider and run for office, HollywoodLifers?",

It sounds like she still feels threatened,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still bad blood with Kelly and Strahan, and she doesn\u2019t want history to repeat itself and Ryan to be lured to \u2018GMA\u2019 too,\u201d the first source said.\n\nBut ABC brass didn\u2019t bat an eye over Ripa\u2019s tantrum given that they\u2019re indebted to her after the way they handled the Strahan situation when he fled to \u201cGMA.\u201d\n\n\u201cKelly isn\u2019t going to be reprimanded for this, as diva-like as it is, because it\u2019s not worth upsetting her for a three-minute hit with Ryan on \u2018GMA.\u2019 They had the three judges, and the big star Katy Perry, anyway,\u201d the source said.\n\nSeacrest\u2019s rep claimed the abrupt cancellation was due to his schedule on \u201cLive!\u201d\n\n\u201cRyan had wanted to appear on \u2018GMA\u2019 with the new \u2018Idol\u2019 judges \u2026 but with the constant shifting of various schedules, we determined yesterday, along with \u2018GMA,\u2019 as well as ABC/Freemantle producers and publicity teams, that his schedule was too tight given his morning commitments with \u2019Live\u2019 and his radio show, along with \u2018Idol\u2019 production commitments \u2026 To suggest any other reason for him not participating is completely false or a misunderstanding of the facts,\u201d his spokesperson said.\n\nAnother insider added, \u201cHow much prep does he really need for \u2018Live!\u2019? It was really odd and confusing. It\u2019s pretty obvious that she\u2019s difficult to work with.\u201d\n\nA rep for Ripa insisted, \u201cThis story is absolutely not true,\u201d but declined to comment further.",

    "content": "One of pop culture's longest-running narratives is the so-called beef between Katy Perry and Taylor Swift. It kicked off in 2014 when Swift released her song \"Bad Blood,\" which allegedly detailed her contentious relationship with Perry. Up until this point, though, that was only half-confirmed. Swift told Rolling Stone in 2014 the song was about another female artist who tried to \"sabotage an entire arena tour,\" but she didn't get specific; two years later, Perry responded to a fan on Twitter that she'd be down to collaborate with Swift \"if she [said] sorry.\" Fans filled in the blanks.\n\nBut now we have confirmation that a Perry\u2013Swift feud actually exists. According to E! News, Perry finally opened up about the squabble during her Carpool Karaoke segment with James Corden on Monday, May 23\u2014and, if her testimony holds water, everything we've previously heard about their relationship is true. Perry confirmed there is a \"situation\" with Swift, and it's rooted in professional drama.\n\n\"Honestly, [Swift] started it, and it's time for her to finish it,\" Perry said. \"It's about backing dancers. It's so crazy. There [are] three backing dancers that went on tour with her tour, and they asked me before they went on tour if they could go. I was like, 'Yeah, of course. I'm not on a record cycle. Get the work. She's great. But I will be on a record cycle, probably, in about a year, so be sure to put a 30-day contingency in your contract so you can get out if you wanna join me when I say I'm going back on.' So that year came up, and I texted all of them because I'm very close with them. I said, 'Look, just FYI: I'm about to start. I want to put the word out there.' They said, 'OK. We're gonna go talk to management about it.' They did, and they got fired. I tried to talk to [Swift] about it, and she wouldn't speak to me. I do the right thing anytime that it feels like a fumble. It was a full shutdown, and then she writes a song about me. And I'm like 'OK, cool, cool. That's how you wanna do it? Karma.'\" (You can watch this portion of Perry's Carpool Karaoke segment here.)\n\nPerry isn't trying to stir the pot, though. She's quite ready for this feud to end and said it would only take a text-message apology from Swift for her to bury the hatchet.\n\n\"I'm ready for that B.S. to be done,\" she said. \"I think, personally, that women together\u2014not divided, none of this petty sh-t\u2014will heal the world.\" (Cheers to that.)\n\nOf course, Perry's confession is just one side of the story. We'll probably never know 100 percent what happened between them, but let's not waste any more energy on it. As Perry said, women are stronger together than apart. That's the motto we all should live by. Sure, \"Bad Blood\" and \"Swish Swish\" are great, but imagine the smash Perry and Swift would create if they joined forces. Let's start a petition for that (instead of more tea on this annoying beef).\n\nRELATED: Katy Perry Just Dropped Her \"Bon App\u00e9tit\" Music Video",

    "content": "Guillermo del Toro Says The Shape of Water Sex Toy is Not Accurate\n\nAs you\u2019ve probably heard by now, XenoCat Artifacts have released an unofficial sex toy modeled after the aquatic creature played by Doug Jones in Guillermo del Toro\u2019s masterpiece The Shape of Water. The product, which has been dubbed \u2018The Jewel of the Amazon\u2019, was clearly a huge success, as it sold out in less than twenty minutes, and I don\u2019t want to think about what the buyers must be doing with them. Anyway, you can learn more about the, um, dildo in an interview with the creators here.\n\nHowever, del Toro has made it clear that he\u2019s not a fan of the rather naughty piece of merchandise. Speaking to The Wrap, he said that the toy, which depicts the creature\u2019s manhood, was not an accurate depiction of how its genitalia would actually look. He was quoted as saying the following:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an accurate representation. It\u2019s some form of fan art\u2026 I guess.\u201d\n\nSeeing as del Toro designed the creature, he has the final say over how its manly parts look. So if he says the dildo\u2019s incorrect, it\u2019s incorrect.\n\nJones was also not particularly fond of the sex toy, saying:\n\n\u201cAfter pouring my heart, soul, blood, sweat, and tears into this romantic, beautiful, magical role, the last thing I want to be remembered for is a silicone appendage that comes in two sizes.\u201d\n\nWe hear you, Doug. And don\u2019t worry, people will be praising your performance in The Shape of Water for years to come.\n\nSo I guess the moral of this story is that you shouldn\u2019t create a sex toy modeled after an amphibious creature\u2019s private parts without first consulting an expert.\n\nAnyway, The Shape of Water also stars Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Octavia Spencer. We loved the film in our review, and it\u2019s also picked up thirteen Oscar nominations in addition to earning a current worldwide total of $75 million. Despite all its success, we\u2019ll probably never truly know what the creature\u2019s penis really looks like. And maybe that\u2019s a good thing.",

    "content": "The 2017 CMA Awards Entertainer of the Year, Garth Brooks, has admitted publicly that he lip-synced his performance of \"Ask Me How I Know\" at the awards show on Wednesday (Nov. 8), and pretty much everyone seems to have an opinion about the situation. Anderson East and Miranda Lambert have made it clear where they stand on the issue in a social media post.\n\nLate Thursday night (Nov. 9), East posted on social media to explain that he, for one, is not a fan of Brooks' decision: \u201cI keep a lot of my opinions to myself and respect anyone making music but as a person who tries to put on the best and most honest show I can night after night \u2026 this truly offends me,\" he writes.\n\n\"I was told country music is three chords and the truth,\" East adds.\n\nHundreds have commented on East's words, both in agreement with him and in defense of Brooks. Lambert is one of the former.\n\n\u201cHigh five on this babe,\" Lambert writes in a comment. \"If you can\u2019t sing then don\u2019t ... It\u2019s better to be honest than to pretend.\"\n\n\"I think it\u2019s bulls--t,\" she continues. \"My favorite performances in the show were live live. The truth.\"\n\nBrooks admitted backstage at the 2017 CMA Awards that he made the decision to lip-sync because he was feeling under the weather. At the same time, ironically, he praised Lambert for her performance during the awards show.\n\n\"Let me tell you who fought the good fight tonight in my opinion: Miranda Lambert,\" Brooks boasted. \"She\u2019s one of the few females that we play, so you\u2019d think she\u2019d want to play it safe. She came out and she stuck country music in all of our faces tonight -- traditional country music.\"\n\nTop 10 2017 CMA Awards Moments",

    "content": "CBS\u2018 new top programming executives addressed the network\u2019s struggles with onscreen diversity Tuesday \u2014 including the recent controversy over the departure of two Asian actors from \u201cHawaii Five-0.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe love both those actors and did not want to lose them,\u201d CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl said at the Television Critics Association press tour on Tuesday. \u201cWe made very, very strong attempts to keep them and offered them a lot of money to stick around.\u201d\n\nIn June, actors Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park exited \u201cHawaii Five-O.\u201d As Variety reported at the time, the actors had been seeking equal pay with stars Alex O\u2019Loughlin and Scott Caan, but failed to reach deals with CBS Television Studios, which produces the series.\n\nThe departure of the show\u2019s only two series regulars of Asian descent over a salary dispute involving the pay scale of their white co-stars sparked criticism of CBS on social media and in the press.\n\nKahl did not go into details of the negotiation, saying, \u201cIn my mind it was purely a business transaction.\u201d He characterized the departure of veteran actors as natural for a show entering its eighth season. \u201cIt\u2019s happened on \u2018CSI,\u2019 it\u2019s happened on \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy,\u2019 it\u2019s happened on \u2018Law and Order: SVU.'\u201d\n\nKahl appeared at TCA alongside senior executive vice president Thom Sherman. The two fielded multiple questions about the network\u2019s poor record with diversity in front of and behind the camera, with one reporter noting that CBS has failed to put a new series with a female lead on the air for two seasons running.\n\n\u201cWe had six pilots with female leads and the way things turned out those pilots were not deemed to be as good as the pilots that were picked up,\u201d Sherman said.\n\nSherman and Kahl did not handle the development slate that led to the upcoming season\u2019s crop of new shows. Kahl, a 21-year veteran of the network and its longtime scheduling chief, was named CBS entertainment president in May. His promotion came with the departure of Glenn Geller, who stepped down as the network\u2019s top programming executive following a mild heart attack suffered in March. As part of the restructuring, Sherman was recruited from sister network the CW to head programming under Kahl.\n\nReporters also grilled Kahl and Sherman on CBS\u2019 casting department, which is staffed entirely by white casting directors, and how it has affected the onscreen diversity or lack thereof in CBS\u2019 series.\n\n\u201cI personally don\u2019t think that has anything to do with it,\u201d Kahl said, adding of the casting department, \u201cThey\u2019re fantastic at what they do,\u201d and noting that it has \u201ccast many diverse roles in the past.\u201d\n\nPressed on why the department is staffed entirely by white casting directors, Sherman said, \u201cThey\u2019ve been together for a long time. That\u2019s the department as its been. But we are cognizant of the issue. We hear you, and we will be looking to expand the casting department.\u201d\n\nAs his predecessors have, Kahl defended CBS\u2019 diversity record and promised it would continue to improve.\n\n\u201cWe can debate the pace of the change, but there is change happening at CBS,\u201d Kahl said, noting an overall uptick in diverse series regulars in recent years. \u201cEvery single drama on our air has at least one diverse regular character.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe said in the past that we\u2019re going to do better, and we are doing better.\u201d",

So, let's see it -- happy birthday!\"\n\nPortia then cuts to a video of her talking about Ellen's hero, Dian Fossey, and her dedication to animals. \"So, for your birthday, Ellen, I am bringing you and your hero, Dian, together by building the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund,\" she reveals. \"Ellen, you will carry on Dian's legacy by giving them a permanent home in Rwanda. Now, you will join Dian as a protector and champion of these amazing animals, the mountain gorillas. Happy birthday!\"\n\nPortia didn't stop there! \"I have also set up a foundation in your name called The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund,\" she shares. \"So, this is the first initiative for the fund that you can take this and do whatever you want with it. You've done amazing work for elephants and you can just continue and support whatever you want to do.\"\n\nBlown over by the gift, Ellen says tearfully, \"It\u2019s the best gift. I\u2019ve always said -- and when we got married, Portia\u2019s line was, 'It\u2019s good to be loved; it\u2019s profound to be understood' -- and, she understands me because that is the best gift that anybody could have given me.

This time, the picture looked more candid and spur of the moment, taken long before Instagram. The image of Michele and Monteith was seems to be an older picture, taken in the days of the Polaroid Instant Camera, though, considering Lea posted many similar images, it may be possible that she was making use of a new app or filter.\n\nThe picture of Lea and Corey shows Ms. Michele snuggling close to her Glee co-star, as Monteith wraps his arms around her in a protective embrace. While the Glee actress didn\u2019t caption this image, the photo seems to speak for itself, alluding to their relationship as it was then.

    "content": "A story about Justin Timberlake dropping a planned tribute to Prince from his upcoming concert tour is completely made-up. Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this bogus story. We're told it's simply not true.\n\nPG / Splash News\n\nLast month, Prince fans criticized Timberlake on social media for incorporating the late singer into his Super Bowl halftime show. During the set, Timberlake created a duet with Prince by performing his song \"I Would Die 4 U\" alongside a giant projection of the late artist. Many fans of Prince believed the use of his image was in poor taste and not something the late musician would have appreciated.\n\nThe National Enquirer is now capitalizing on the controversy by claiming that Timberlake was planning to pay homage to Prince during his 2018 Man of the Woods tour, but scrapped the idea following the Super Bowl backlash. A so-called \"source\" tells the magazine, \"Since the devastating reviews of his Super Bowl performance, all Prince references have been removed.\"\n\nBut Gossip Cop checked in with a source close to Timberlake, who exclusively assures us the tabloid's story is completely false. We're told the singer never planned to include a Prince tribute in his tour. It should be noted, the main reason that Timberlake acknowledged the late singer at the Super Bowl is because the game was played in Prince's hometown of Minneapolis.\n\nDuring an appearance on a special post-Super Bowl edition of \"The Tonight Show,\" Timberlake explained to Jimmy Fallon that he honored Prince \"to do something for this city and something for him that would just be the ultimate homage to what I consider the GOAT of musicians.\" Despite Timberlake's admiration for the late artist, the homage was specifically designed for the Super Bowl in Minneapolis, and he never intended to bring the tribute on the road.\n\nIt's also worth noting, the Enquirer seems to know very little about Timberlake's career. Gossip Cop previously busted the untrustworthy magazine for wrongly reporting that the singer would be hosting the Oscars. The publication is no better when it comes to covering his personal life, as we've also debunked the outlet's many false articles surrounding Timberlake's marriage to Jessica Biel. This latest story claiming Prince was supposed to play a part in the singer's Man of the Woods tour is equally bogus.\n\nMore on Gossip Cop:\n\nJennifer Aniston did NOT throw Justin Theroux's things in trash despite report\n\nRihanna thinking babies with Hassan Jameel is made-up\n\nDo Katy Perry's friends want her to dump Orlando Bloom for Jake Gyllenhaal?",

Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.\n\n\u201cIt is true that I have been reprimanded twice during this past season of Lethal Weapon. The first reprimand was because I reacted with anger over working conditions that did not feel safe or conducive to good work under the leadership of a guest director and assistant director who, in turn, were angry at my response. I met with Human Resources, I apologized for my part of the conflict, and I completed studio-appointed therapy. I even shared a sizable portion of my paycheck with one of the parties involved per the instruction of the studio,\u201d Crawford began.\n\nFOX via Getty\n\nHe wrote about the second incident that took place on the set of the drama series: \u201cThe second reprimand came during an episode I was directing. An actor on set felt unsafe because a piece of shrapnel from an effect hit him. It was an unfortunate event that happened in spite of all safety precautions and procedures being followed. I take responsibility for the incident because I was in charge of the set.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Mayer/WireImage; Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic\n\nThe actor continued by sharing that he has absolute \u201clove, respect and care for my crew and cast, and would never intentionally jeopardize so many jobs. Moreover, I love the process of making film and television. I appreciate and respect the work of everyone involved. It takes a village. I am incredibly sorry if my passion for doing good work has ever made anyone feel less than comfortable on our set, or feel less than celebrated for their efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurthermore, I apologize to all the crew and cast for any negative attention Lethal Weapon is receiving because of these incidents,\u201d continued Crawford, who said that he takes \u201cgreat pride in treating everyone in life with dignity and kindness.\u201d\n\nLast week, Entertainment Weekly confirmed a report from The Hollywood Reporter that stated Fox and its studio partner Warner Bros. TV were searching for a new actor to play Riggs if the series was renewed for a third season.\n\nCrawford seemingly responded on Twitter Tuesday by first sharing a photo of himself on a boat with his arms up and the caption, \u201cHmmmmmm?\u201d and then tweeting, \u201cWait, wait, wait\u2026\u2026you can\u2019t fire me on my day off!\u201d\n\nSeann William Scott was hired to replace Crawford as Riggs\u2019 brother, according to Variety.",

The two were the romantic leads in a giant movie franchise, traveling the world together and walking red carpets nonstop for roughly four years.

She has always been a very serious, and very good, actress, highly in demand since her breakthrough role in Panic Room alongside Jodie Foster almost 20 years ago. She is definitely not dating Robert Pattinson.\n\nThis clearly proves that even if someone wanted to make a comparison between these girls, they would be very hard-pressed to come up with something, save their fondness for Robby.\n\nIn addition, this also proves that everyone\u2019s favorite sparkly vampire most definitely does not have a \u201ctype.\u201d",

During their recent trip to Paris, Jolie and her six kids visited the famous bridge overlooking the River Seine, and her 11-year-old daughter Shiloh fastened a lock marked with the first initial of everyone in the family, except her dad, and then threw the key into the water.\n\nThe French tradition \u2013 where Parisians and tourists write their names and date on a lock before throwing the key in the water \u2013 is a symbol that they are all \u201clocked in love forever.\u201d\n\nSince Shiloh didn\u2019t include her dad\u2019s initial it seems that she may have been disowning her dad, says a source close to the family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Kerby Alvy, the author of Parenting Errors, says that it\u2019s a mistake for Angelina Jolie not to include Pitt (the non-custodial parent) in family events because it sends a negative message to the kids that Brad Pitt is no longer part of the family.",

News, it has been confirmed that the late actor's body will be cremated after it was discovered at a nearby wooded area near his home in the Sunland-Tujunga neighborhood of L.A. The discovery came after one of his family members had reported him missing at 3 a.m. Tuesday. The Los Angeles Police Department had confirmed that Salling's body had been discovered hanging at around 8:50 a.m.\n\n\"I can confirm that Mark Salling passed away early this morning,\" Salling's attorney, Michael J. Proctor, said in a statement. \"Mark was a gentle and loving person, a person of great creativity, who was doing his best to atone for some serious mistakes and errors of judgment. He is survived by his mother and father, and his brother,\" Proctor's statement added.\n\nShortly after, the Los Angeles County Coroner confirmed the actor's death to have been caused by asphyxia by hanging and that the manner had been suicide.\n\nThe news came while the 35-year-old awaited his final sentencing after pleading guilty to receiving and possessing of child pornography. Back in 2015, authorities had managed to seize about 26,000 images and 600 videos of child pornography in the \"Glee\" actor's thumb drives and personal computer, featuring infants and children as young as three being sexually abused. He was officially charged on May 2016 for receiving and possessing child pornography.\n\nOn Dec. 2017, the actor pleaded guilty to these charges, and as part of his plea deal, he would've received a prison sentence that ranged from four to seven years instead of the maximum 20 years for his case. He would've also been sentenced to pay $50,000 in restitution to any victim who would ask of it.\n\nNow, after his death, it has been reported that the federal prosecutors are planning to drop all the charges against Mark Salling. \"If that person dies accidentally or by suicide, the government can no longer proceed,\" former prosecutor Manny Medrano said in a report published by Buzzfeed News. \"Essentially, no defendant, no criminal prosecution,\" he added.",

    "content": "Story highlights Eminem slammed Trump in a freestyle rap at the BET Hip Hop awards He added a 'F--- you' to any of his fans who support Trump\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nIn what is perhaps the fiercest and the most exhaustive attack against Donald Trump in hip-hop, Eminem \u201ccame to stomp\u201d Tuesday night, calling the President everything from \u201cDonald the b\u2014-\u201d to a \u201cracist grandpa\u201d in an explosive 4.5-minute freestyle rap.\n\nThe Detroit rapper challenged his fans at the BET Hip Hop Awards to \u201cdecide who you like more\u201d \u2013 Eminem or Trump. He has slammed the President previously in the nine-minute 2016 freestyle \u201cCampaign Speech\u201d and in Big Sean\u2019s \u201cNo Favors.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd any fan of mine who\u2019s a supporter of his, I\u2019m drawing in the sand a line, you\u2019re either for or against, and if you can\u2019t decide who you like more and you\u2019re split on who you should stand beside, I\u2019ll do it for it for you with this. F\u2014 you,\u201d he said toward the end, raising his middle finger.\n\nA request to the White House for comment was not immediately returned.\n\nThe latest freestyle, which Eminem revealed on Twitter is called \u201cThe Storm,\u201d comes as anticipation for Eminem\u2019s eighth studio release builds. The rapper decried Trump\u2019s comments following the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, questioned the President\u2019s own patriotism following his attacks on athletes and Sen. John McCain, and in closing, issued a passionate tribute to Colin Kaepernick.\n\nFOR MORE: Check out the series\n\n\u201cI appreciate you @Eminem,\u201d Kaepernick tweeted, along with a fist emoji.\n\nThe former San Francisco 49ers quarterback is now a free agent after he rose to national prominence last fall when he refused to stand for the national anthem to protest police brutality. Eminem previously expressed his support for Kaepernick in \u201cCampaign Speech.\u201d\n\nHere are the 11 most explosive lines from his newest anti-Trump freestyle in the order that they appear:\n\n1) \u2018A kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s the full verse: \u201cWe better give Obama props \u2018cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust while the drama pops, and he waits for s\u2014 to quiet down, he\u2019ll just gas his plane up and fly around till the bombing stops.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Hip-hop stars slam Trump amid anthem firestorm\n\nHere, Eminem is likely referencing Trump\u2019s war of words on social media with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, whom the President referred to as \u201clittle rocket man.\u201d\n\n2) \u2018Trump, when it comes to giving a s\u2014 you\u2019re stingy as I am\u2019\n\nThis line comes after Eminem references rising tensions in America.\n\n3) \u2018Racism\u2019s the only thing he\u2019s Fantastic 4 cause that\u2019s how he gets his rock off, he\u2019s orange\u2019\n\nFantastic Four - Heroes Unite Trailer (2015) - Miles Teller, Jamie Bell Superhero Movie HD\n\n4) \u2018Cause he cannot withstand the fact we\u2019re not afraid of Trump\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s the full verse: \u201cThat\u2019s why he wants us to disband cause he cannot withstand the fact we\u2019re not afraid of Trump. Walking on egg shells, I came to stomp. That\u2019s why he keeps screaming, \u2018Drain the swamp,\u2019 cause he\u2019s in quicksand.\u201d\n\nHere, Eminem criticizes those who have been tepid when it comes to expressing their opposition to the President.\n\n5) \u2018All these horrible tragedies and he\u2019s bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm\u2019\n\n\u201cBut this is his form of distraction, plus he gets an enormous reaction when he attacks the NFL, so we focus on that instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada. All these horrible tragedies and he\u2019s bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm with the Packers.\u201d\n\nHere, the rapper slams the President for spending days attacking NFL players who take a knee and escalating the feud as a hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico and a massacre occurred in Nevada. Trump visited both Puerto Rico and Las Vegas following each disaster.\n\n6) \u2018Who\u2019s going to pay for his extravagant trips\u2019\n\nFull verse: \u201cHe says he wants to lower our taxes, then who\u2019s going to play for his extravagant trips back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?\u201d\n\nLast month Trump unveiled a Republican framework for tax reform that calls for sweeping tax cuts and a simplification of the tax code.\n\n7) \u2018Same s\u2014 that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more\u2019\n\nFull verse: \u201cSame s\u2014 that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more. From his endorsement of Bannon, support for the Klansman, tiki torches in hand for the solider that\u2019s black and comes home from Iraq and is still told to go back to Africa.\u201d\n\nHere, Eminem is referring to Trump\u2019s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who is also the executive chairman of the conservative media outlet Breitbart News.\n\n8) \u2018This racist 94-year old grandpa\u2019\n\nThis line comes before the rapper says Trump is ignoring America\u2019s racist past.\n\n9) \u2018To him, you\u2019re zero cause he don\u2019t like his war heroes captured\u2019\n\n\u201cHe says you\u2019re spitting in the face of vets who fought for us you b\u2014\u2014-, Unless you\u2019re a POW who\u2019s tortured \u2026 cause to him you\u2019re zero cause he don\u2019t like his war heroes captured. That\u2019s not disrespecting the military.\u201d\n\nEminem accuses the President of disrespecting the military \u2013 a charge that Trump recently leveled against athletes who take a knee during the national anthem. In this lyric, he references Trump\u2019s previous attacks on Arizona Sen. John McCain, who spent five years as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. In 2015, Trump questioned whether McCain is a war hero, saying, \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured, OK?\u201d\n\n10) \u2018F\u2014 that, this is for Colin, ball up a fist and keep that s\u2014 balled like Donald the b\u2014-\u2018\n\nYou can check out hip-hop\u2019s strongest lyrics on Kaepernick HERE.\n\n11) \u2018The rest of America stand up. We love our military and we love our country but we f\u2014\u2014 hate Trump\u2019\n\nEminem\u2019s latest attack is part of a larger trend in hip-hop, which turned on Trump in 2016 and largely settled for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, after nearly three decades of idolizing his wealth and power in hundreds of lyrics.",

    "content": "If you care, it turns out that Kanye West may have been facing some serious repercussions at home after his infamous slavery comments, believing that his wife, Kim Kardashian West, might have divorced him because of his callous (not to mention misinformed) words.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, the rapper spoke a little more in-depth about the song \u201cWouldn\u2019t Leave\u201d on his latest album, Ye, in which he suggested that his TMZ appearance and subsequent comments put his marriage in jeopardy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere was a moment where I felt like after TMZ, maybe a week after that, I felt like the energy levels were low, and I called different family members and was asking, you know, \u2018Was Kim thinking about leaving me after TMZ?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo that was a real conversation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho could forget that interview last month when West put his whole entire ass-leg in his mouth?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen you hear about slavery for 400 years ... for 400 years? That sound like a choice,\u201d he said during his conversation with Ms. Respectability Politics, Candace Owens.\n\n\u201cLike \u2026 you was there for 400 years and it\u2019s all of y\u2019all?\u201d he added, pouring a little more salt into the already festering wound.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurns out Kim didn\u2019t vibe with that at all, not that you would know it with the Kardashians\u2019 carefully curated image. Kim stood by her husband\u2019s side without a murmur of dissent throughout the whole ordeal as well as the release of his new album.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cKim and Kanye have a solid relationship, even with what\u2019s going on right now,\u201d a source told E ! News at the time. \u201cShe loves and supports her husband. Even if they have differences in views and opinions, she knows his heart.\u201d\n\nAs for Kanye himself, in the Times interview, he attempted to clean up his projectile vomit himself, claiming that he just said that it \u201csounded\u201d like a choice, not that he said it actually was a choice. Semantics, people!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said the idea of sitting in something for 400 years sounds\u2014sounds\u2014like a choice to me. I never said it\u2019s a choice. I never said slavery itself\u2014like being shackled in chains\u2014was a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I went from slave to 400 years to mental prison to this and that. If you look at the clip, you see the way my mind works.\u201d\n\nStill, the artist said that he \u201clearned so much\u201d from the incident.\n\n\u201c I learned about the context of the idea of the word \u2018slave.\u2019 I didn\u2019t take it in that context. I think that my personality and energy mirrors Nat Turner, or it had in the past, but that showed me that also that Nat Turner approach would land me in the same place Nat Turner landed, and that I would be legendary but also just a martyr,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I guess we\u2019re all martyrs eventually, and we\u2019re all guaranteed to die.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if he could reframe his comments today, well ...\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t frame a one-liner or a headline. What I would say is actually it\u2019s literally like I feel like I\u2019m in court having to justify a robbery that I didn\u2019t actually commit, where I\u2019m having to somehow reframe something that I never said. I feel stupid to have to say out loud that I know that being put on the boat was\u2014but also I\u2019m not backing down, bro,\u201d the artist added. \u201cWhat I will do is I\u2019ll take responsibility for the fact that I allowed my voice to be used back to back in ways that were not protective of it when my voice means too much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWearing the [Donald Trump] hat, because my voice is unprotected, and I believe that the black community wants to protect my voice. By me saying \u2018slave\u2019 in any way at TMZ left my voice unprotected. So it\u2019s not a matter of the facts of if I said that exact line or not; it\u2019s the fact that I put myself in a position to be unprotected by my tribe,\u201d he said.",

    "content": "David Cassidy, the teen heartthrob star of the hit \"The Partridge Family\" who went on to have a long show business career although he battled alcoholism later in life, is dead, his publicist said Tuesday. He was 67. Cassidy died surrounded by his family, his publicist said. Cassidy's nephew tweeted that he didn't think \"I'm alone in saying that we will all miss him.\"\n\nMy uncle David Cassidy has sadly passed away tonight... & in the process of mourning I can't help but thank God for the joy that he brought to countless millions of people! I don't think I'm alone in saying that we will all miss him. God Speed! \u2014 Jack Cassidy (@jackgcassidy) November 22, 2017\n\nCassidy said in February that he was suffering from dementia.\n\n\"I was in denial, but a part of me always knew this was coming,\" he told People magazine about his diagnosis. His mother had suffered from the disease.\n\nCassidy was born in 1950 to singer and actor Jack Cassidy and actress Evelyn Ward. His big break came at age 20 when he nabbed the role of Keith Partridge, one of the singing kids of \"The Partridge Family,\" alongside his real-life stepmother Shirley Jones.\n\nThe show centered around a widow and her five children who traveled the country in a psychedelically-painted school bus. It ran from 1970-74, providing a feel-good, family show as the country struggled to find its footing after the tumultuous 1960s.\n\nWhile \"The Partridge Family\" was never a huge hit in the ratings, the show excelled in tie-ins and producing hit songs. The theme song \"Come On, Get Happy\" became a hit, and the cast would later go on to make ten albums, all of which sold more than 1 million copies.\n\nThis 1970 photo released by courtesy of Sony Pictures Television shows, back row, from left, cast members, Shirley Jones, Dave Madden, David Cassidy, Susan Dey, and front row, from left, Brian Forster, Danny Bonaduce and Suzanne Crough of the television series, \"The Partridge Family.\" AP\n\nAnd Cassidy was the biggest star of them all. He went solo in 1971, with his song \"Cherish,\" becoming a No. 1 hit. He had pop-star good looks and the 1970s trademark shaggy hair, helping fuel his teen idol status. He posed shirtless on the cover of Rolling Stone in 1972 with the headline \"Naked Lunch Box.\" He tried to reject his \"bubble-gum\" image, talking about his drug use (\"not smack, but grass and speed and psychedelics\").\n\nCassidy sold out Madison Square Garden in one day and toured internationally. But at London's White City Stadium, a 14-year-old girl was killed in a stampede when the 35,000 crowd surged forward when he appeared on stage. One ambulance man said the scene reminded him of the Blitz, according to The Independent.\n\nBy the end of 1974, \"The Partridge Family\" had ended and Cassidy quit touring, ending his days as a pop star. He eventually climbed back to the Top 40 with the 1990's \"Lyin' to Myself.\"\n\nSinger David Cassidy and wife Susan attend Rolling Stone Magazine's 1000th cover celebration on May 4, 2006, in New York. Getty\n\nHe continued to act, receiving an Emmy nomination for his role in \"Police Story\" in 1978. He starred in the short-lived series, \"David Cassidy: Man Undercover\" in 1978. He also took a turn at Broadway in a critically acclaimed role in \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" in 1982.\n\nHe appeared as one of the contestants on \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" although he was one of the first to be fired in 2011.\n\nLater in life, Cassidy struggled with alcoholism and money troubles. He said he began drinking in 2002, and he was arrested several times for DUIs and sent through several rehab stints. He told CNN in 2014 that he was an alcoholic.\n\nA month after his January 2014 arrest, his wife, Sue Shifrin-Cassidy, filed for divorce. He filed for bankruptcy in February 2015 and gave a bizarre interview on Britain's \"This Morning\" where he was accused of \"delusion\" and \"rudeness.\"\n\nEventually, he publicly announced he was suffering from dementia after he forgot the lyrics to some of his songs onstage. He said he wanted to focus on health and happiness for the remainder of his life.\n\n\"I want to focus on what I am, who I am and how I've been without any distractions,\" he told People. \"I want to love. I want to enjoy life.\"",

While he\u2019s physically distant from his girl, he\u2019s been working on closing the emotional distance that opened up between them after he got rude on IG. \u201cHe has been apologizing, sending her sweet texts and flowers to let her know that he is sorry for the foolish remark,\u201d the insider says. \u201cBut it is impossible to make things right with her while he is on the road.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe feels horrible because he really loves her and doesn\u2019t want to lose her over the impulsive comment he regrets,\u201d the insider added. \u201cBut he feels like things have changed between them and he wants to get back to her ASAP to get on her good side again or he fears he may lose her forever.\u201d For those who forgot: Kourt uploaded a picture of her in a thong-bikini on July 16, showing off her bare butt and killer figure. \u201cThat\u2019s what you need to show to get likes?\u201d Younes asked, pretty much calling her thirsty for all to see.\n\nSuddenly, Kourt is looking at Kylie Jenner\u2019s relationship with Travis Scott with envy in her eyes, while Scott Disick was reveling in the drama. Younes tried to play nice when she posted a picture of herself showing off some leg while lying in bed. Yet, when Kourt\u2019s bestie Simon Huck rolled his eyes at the comment, Younes said he was just trying to \u201cplay around fam.\u201d Hmm. Perhaps Younes should give serious thought to deleting his account \u2013 or, at least, stay out of the comments section.",

    "content": "Months after Rob Kardashian\u2018s drama with Blac Chyna reached its explosive peak, the aftermath is being documented on Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nIn a preview of Sunday\u2019s episode, sisters Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian sit down to discuss their brother\u2019s bitter legal battle with his ex-fianc\u00e9e, which began after he posted graphic and expletive-ridden content about her on social media in July \u2014 including three naked photos \u2014 while accusing her of drug use, alcohol abuse and infidelity.\n\n\u201cDid you see how I just went off on Rob in our group text?\u201d says Kim, 37. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take it.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9, 33, points out that there\u2019s a \u201cplus and a minus\u201d to the situation \u2014 with the plus side being that there\u2019s \u201cno way\u201d Rob, 30, and Chyna, 29, could \u201cget back together after this.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s focus on the positive,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 says. \u201cThe negative is all of this other s\u2014 right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe negative is just that like, with Rob having sisters, he should just know better,\u201d Kim says. \u201cHe should have just like, controlled himself.\u201d\n\nBut Khlo\u00e9 is still in Rob\u2019s corner.\n\n\u201cIt just sucks,\u201d she tells Kim. \u201cHe\u2019s made out to [be] this bad guy when [Chyna] is taunting him. Love makes you do f\u2014ed up things. Do you think anyone\u2019s proud of that? No. You don\u2019t f\u2014 with someone\u2019s heart and emotions.\u201d\n\nAfter Rob\u2019s social media rampage, Chyna and her legal team accused him of violating California\u2019s revenge porn laws, claiming in court documents obtained by PEOPLE that he allegedly hit her and threatened to kill himself multiple times. A judge later granted her a set of restraining orders against her ex.\n\nHis actions launched a two-month-long custody war over their 14-month-old daughter Dream Ren\u00e9e. The two agreed to joint custody Sept. 15, PEOPLE confirmed \u2014 though at the time, Chyna\u2019s lawyer Lisa Bloom said the decision \u201cdoes not resolve all disputes between Chyna and Rob.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Rob and Chyna have officially broken up, but they obviously still have to communicate for the custody of Dream,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 says in the sneak peek. \u201cThey\u2019re still having a hard time getting along. The legal battle that has been going on between the two of them has been super frustrating. I feel like this is escalating to a place that none of us could have ever imagined.\u201d\n\nIn September, Rob and his sister Kylie Jenner, 20, sued Chyna for battery, assault and vandalism, alleging she attempted to choke Kardashian with an iPhone cord during a fight in December 2016. (Jenner owns the home where the alleged altercation took place.)\n\nIn the complaint, the siblings alleged Chyna made a \u201cdeliberate attempt to extort the Kardashian family for her own monetary gains\u201d and claimed her decision to have a baby with Rob was \u201cnothing short of an outright fraud to shake down the Kardashian family.\u201d\n\nIn October, Chyna filed her own lawsuit against her ex for allegedly damaging her brand and verbally and physically abusing her. In the filing obtained by PEOPLE, Chyna claims she has suffered \u201csignificant damages\u201d from his social media posts. She alleged the nude photo scandal \u2014 along with influence from the Kardashian family \u2014 are what got Rob & Chyna, her and Rob\u2019s E! reality show, axed before a season 2.\n\nShe also accused Rob of physical abuse, alleging that her ex once grabbed her phone out of her hand and \u201cviolently knocked her to the ground where she landed on her hands and knees\u201d after she tried to call Tyga, with whom she shares 5-year-old son King Cairo and who previously dated Jenner for almost three years.\n\nRob, who denies the assault claims, and his family have requested that the case be dismissed. According to court documents filed Dec. 27 in the Superior Court of Los Angeles and obtained by The Blast, Rob \u201cgenerally and specifically denies each of the allegations\u201d and claimed Chyna \u201cdid not suffer any injury or harm as a result of any conduct by [Kardashian].\u201d\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE in response, Chyna\u2019s attorney said, \u201cWe are confident that we will prevail on this motion and at trial.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians airs this Sunday and Monday at 9 p.m. ET on E!",

    "content": "Mary Cadden\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSummertime and the reading is, well, mostly easy. Turns out, some of our favorite celebrities have some pretty impressive reading goals. But don't worry, there is also plenty of fun fiction too. Our intrepid band of bookworms is nothing if not eclectic in their literary habits. So if you are in the need for some suggestions on what to read next, here is a round up of what the CBC has been (and plans on) reading this summer.\n\nReese Witherspoon\n\nAs usual, Reese is all business, forget an actual reading list, she already has the books. And judging from what we see, she has a pretty interesting summer of reading ahead of her.\n\nA quick rundown of the titles, The Clasp by Sloane Crosley, Wildflower by Drew Barrymore, The Story of a New Name by Elena Ferrante, we believe the next one is The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry by Jon Ronson, The Testament of Mary by Colm Tobin, So You've been Perfectly Shamed by Jon Ronson and Why Not Me by Mindy Kaling. A pretty eclectic bunch of titles, from fiction to non-fiction to memoirs.\n\nEarlier in the summer, Reese also read and recommended fellow club member Kimberly Williams Paisley's Where the Light Gets In.\n\nCelebrity book club: Spring break edition\n\nLena Dunham\n\nThe actress and newfound publisher spent the Memorial Day weekend with the novel The Innocents and Others by Dana Spiotta and Hilary Mantel's memoir Giving Up the Ghost. But no word on other books she plans to read this summer. You would have to check out her current Lit Thursday suggestions at her Lenny Letter.\n\nWhile we don't have her future reads, we did find out that Dunham is a big fan of Nora Ephron, who was no stranger to our best-selling books list. We have a feeling she would heartily recommend each and every title.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar\n\nWe have a newbie in the club this week, and we hope she will continue to share her favorite reads. Sarah Michelle Gellar - yes can't not say all three names - posted about a little something called #Readathon2016 a few weeks ago. How did we miss this? Well, thanks to SMG, we will know to look for next year's #Readathon.\n\nSMG' is currently reading, Eligible by Curtis Sittenfeld, Orphan Train by Christian Baker Kline and one she is reading with her daughter Charlotte, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by J.K. Rowling.\n\nEmma Roberts\n\nHerculean is the word that comes to mind when perusing this list. And as always, Emma impressive reading goals. For your reading pleasure - as well as eyesight - we include the titles and authors from her hand written list below.\n\nThe Social Contract by Jean Jacques Rousseau, A Little Life by Hanya Yanagirhara, Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage by Haruki Maurakami, Of Time and an Island by John Keats, Play It As It Lays by Joan Didion, The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus, Franny and Zooey by J. D. Salinger, The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt, In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust, The Sport of Kings by C.E. Morgan, The Atomic Weight of Love by Elizabeth J. Church and What I Talk About When I Talk About Running by Haruki Murakami. Yep, that is a mighty impressive list.\n\nBut don't be intimidated, Emma's recommendations run the gamut. If you prefer something on the lighter side of lit we agree with Emma and recommend Sweetbitter by Stephanie Danler,\n\nCelebrity Book Club 2016: New year, new books\n\nKimberly Paisley Williams\n\nAs usual, KPW (sorry, but three names means you get to go by your initials, just ask SMG) does not disappoint and has adult and children's book recommendations.\n\nFirst there is Time and Again by Jack Finney and My Brilliant Friendby Elena Ferrante for adults...\n\n... and for children, A Long Way from Chicago by Richard Peck.\n\nEmma Watson\n\nLast, but certainly not least, we have Emma's Our Shared Shelf's book club. Emma has begun recommending the club's picks on Instagram.\n\nThe most recent book is Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi. But it has been a while since we have gotten the gang together and her book group also read The Argonauts by Maggie Nelson and, one of our personal favorites, How To Be a Woman by Caitlin Moran.\n\nHappy Reading!",

After a small group of family and friends-who had been invited to a \"special barbecue\"-were let in on the secret, the celebration of life and love began.\n\n02 of 11 The Lyrics A wagon wheel-the name of O'Connell and Romijn's ranch-motif adorned songs sheets handed to the guests, who joined in as a gospel choir serenaded the bride down the aisle with a chorus of Foreigner's \"I Want to Know What Love Is.\" \"I picked that song because I liked the sentiment,\" Romijn has said. \"I was creating an experience for everybody, myself included.\"\n\n03 of 11 The Gown Joe Buissink Romijn's father, Jaap, escorted her down the grassy aisle.

The day marked Fox\u2019s first (and only) celebrity wedding. While it was originally planned as a big October wedding at the Bacara in Santa Barbara, things rapidly changed after the paparazzi figured out the date and location. Fox was left with about 10 days to organize a completely new, surprise wedding \u2014 and, not trusting any other venue to keep the secret, she held it at her own house.\n\nMost Britney fans probably don\u2019t celebrate her short-lived marriage\u2019s anniversary; some even see it as a key moment in a downward spiral from which she has only recently recovered. Still, though Britney filed for divorce in 2006, Fox holds that marriage dear.\n\nTIME spoke to Fox about the whirlwind wedding, young love and the groomsmens\u2019 infamous white Juicy velour \u201cpimp\u201d tracksuits.\n\nTIME: Britney and Kevin Federline\u2019s engagement was huge. Did you think that this would be one of the biggest weddings-\n\nAlyson Fox: \u2014of my career? Yes, I mean, she is Britney Spears. I first interviewed with Felicia, her assistant for years, and I didn\u2019t know who I was meeting with, just that it was a VIP\u2026 I met Britney and her mom the next day and they all couldn\u2019t be nicer. The sweetest. I mean they\u2019re from the South. Britney\u2019s so polite, she kept calling me Miss Alyson, and I was like, \u2018Oh my God don\u2019t do that; that makes me feel old.\u2019\n\nAnd then you met Kevin.\n\nThey were like any young couple. Very much in love, very touchy feely.\n\nWhat was the original wedding going to be like?\n\nThey came up with a list of 200 to 250 people, and we thought the Bacara would be great. We were designing the most beautiful but not over the top, elegant but shabby chic, gorgeous but fun event\u2026 It was a really fun experience. I have not one negative thing to say until we had to move the whole wedding.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nA publication printed the location and date of the wedding. I got a call from a very unhappy Kevin. [Unhappy at the situation not her.] Even though I told them that we had the best security team and it could still go on without a hitch, they didn\u2019t want 100 million people standing outside trying to take pictures, ruining the intimacy and privacy of that event. So we had to go to Plan B, and we had to do it fast.\n\nYou had a \u201cPlan B\u201d?\n\nWell, we planned it in 10 days or less\u2026 Everything was already in the works, Monique Lhuillier was making all the gowns that were basically ready, all the vendors were in place for the big wedding \u2014 we just didn\u2019t have a location. In that week we decided we can\u2019t do it at a hotel, we can\u2019t do a venue because people were going to know. We limited the guest list to the two families and the wedding party, and then we talked to Britney and Kevin about doing a surprise wedding. Nobody would know.\n\nNot even Britney\u2019s mom?\n\nNo. Nobody knew\u2026 We told everyone and our vendors we were having an engagement party. We tried to use every vendor we could who was going to help at the wedding.\n\nAnd you would throw it at your house in Studio City?\n\nWell, their place wasn\u2019t ready yet\u2026 The vendors made the house look stunning. It was so beautiful. I only wish they could have had more people\u2026 Every person who walked in that night, we handed then an invitation, they opened it up and it said \u201csurprise!\u201d you are here for the wedding and not the engagement party. And we would direct them to the room where they would change into their gowns and tuxedos\u2026\n\nTuxedos? I thought the men were wearing those white Juicy velour jumpsuits\u2026\n\nNo! That\u2019s what they left the house in. They were in tuxedos and gowns. Everybody made such a big deal about that, but that\u2019s what Juicy did for every celebrity who got married. They\u2019d send them the cute little tracksuits. I asked Britney and Kevin what they wanted printed on the back, and Britney said, \u201cMaids! Maids will be cute!\u201d And it was. It was cute! And he said \u201cPimps\u201d which was adorable\u2026 People are closed-minded. It was a joke, it was for fun. It was Juicy tracksuits! 10 years ago people would have given anything for a Juicy tracksuit.\n\nYou must not have gotten a lot of sleep that week.\n\nOh I didn\u2019t sleep that week. And I didn\u2019t sleep the week after, because there were all these stories going on [at the time] that they weren\u2019t really married, and all this B.S. People are going to think what they\u2019re going to think, but I know the truth. They were wonderful people and I\u2019ll say that until the day I die. To this day I don\u2019t talk to a lot of people about it because I still feel protective over them. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t work out \u2014 but what is it, 60% of marriages that don\u2019t?\n\nRead TIME\u2019s 1999 profile of Britney Spears here, in the archives: A Sweet Sensation",

Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images\n\nThe INSIDER Summary:\n\nKim Kardashian has responded to criticism over the position of her son Saint West's car seat.\n\nThe mom of two posted a photo of her 20-month-old son in a forward-facing car seat on Facebook this June.\n\nIn the comments, many people argued the car seat position was unsafe and broke California state law that requires toddlers under 2 to sit in rear-facing seats.\n\nHowever, the law doesn't apply to children who are over 40 inches tall or weigh more than 40 pounds.\n\nIn a new video, Kardashian explained that Saint West meets those requirements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike other celebrity moms, Kim Kardashian West is used to being criticized for her parenting decisions.\n\nThe reality star recently defended her parenting skills in a new video, which we first read about on People.\n\nIn the video, posted to her website, Kardashian addressed accusations from Facebook users who claimed that she put her son Saint West in danger \u2014 and potentially even broke the law \u2014 by placing him in a forward-facing car seat.\n\nHere's the offending photo that Kardashian shared on Facebook this June:\n\nMany people in the comments suggested the position of the 20-month-old's car seat wasn't safe, and pointed to a California law passed in January 2017 that says children under the age of two must sit in rear-facing car seats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's illegal to have a child facing forward in California that is less than 2 years old,\" one user commented. \"Please turn his car seat around, it's not too late!\" Another person wrote: \"Let's protect this handsome boy by making sure [the seat is] rear facing.\"\n\nHowever, the law also mandates that rear-facing car seats are not applicable to children with a height of 40 inches or more, or a weight of over 40 pounds.\n\nIn the video, Kardashian said that her son meets these requirements, and therefore can sit in a forward-facing seat.\n\n\"What people didn't know is that Saint is now the weight and height requirement to sit forward-facing,\" she said. \"Saint actually weighs more than North, if that is believable.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Saint meets the requirements, as this September 2016 article from BabyCenter points out, when a child outgrows their rear-facing car seat's weight and height limits, they can be accommodated in a convertible seat with more room for their height and weight.\n\nBoth the American Association of Pediatricians and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recommend that children sit in rear-facing car seats until they are aged 2 or 3, or too big for them.\n\nWhile rear-facing seats are designed to give better support to a child's head, neck, and spine, according to the same article, they are also designed to protect their arms and legs.\n\n\"In a forward-facing car seat during an accident, your child's arms and legs fly forward and are more likely to be injured,\" Ben Hoffman, a pediatrician who specializes in injury prevention at the Doernbecher Children's Hospital at Oregon Health & Science University, told BabyCenter. \"In a rear-facing car seat, the chance of injuries to the arms and legs in a crash is less than 1 in 10,000.\"\n\nRegardless of where you stand on the debate, it's not the first time Kardashian has defended herself for how she chooses to parent her kids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn July, the reality star responded to people who shamed her for dressing her 4-year-old daughter North West in a corset-style dress with a Snapchat video that showed her dress didn't feature a real corset, but rather a lace-up detail designed to look like one.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Jun 6, 2017 at 4:30pm PDT Jun 6, 2017 at 4:30pm PDT\n\nPerhaps, next time, it's best not to judge other people's parenting at all.",

This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine\u2019s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.\n\nWe\u2019re in Stanley\u2019s on St Andrew\u2019s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It\u2019s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of \u201cLet\u2019s go out, but not to our usual place\u201d. I\u2019ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don\u2019t come easily.\n\nBut two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley\u2019s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we\u2019re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There\u2019s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nFor the moment, it feels like we\u2019re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we\u2019ll remember fondly when we get home.\n\nThe menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.\n\nThe star of Stanley's is Morgan Vanderkamer. She's the sommelier here. But don't let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.\n\nThe main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We\u2019re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is \u201camazing\u201d, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a \u20ac16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at \u20ac13 a glass. It is a good decision.\n\nThere\u2019s a small farmyard on that \u20ac16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the \u201cbacon and cabbage\u201d, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.\n\nJust in case there isn\u2019t enough on the plate (there is), we\u2019ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas \u2013 but that\u2019s even better in my book \u2013 and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It\u2019s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.\n\nDessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There\u2019s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that\u2019s served deliciously chilly. It\u2019s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we\u2019ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.\n\nRomantic is a bleached-out word, but that\u2019s what Stanley\u2019s wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.\n\nDinner for two, with sherries and wine, came to \u20ac84.75.",

He was asleep when police investigating the case found him.\n\nThe man, 22-year-old Roger Alvardo, was charged with stalking, burglary, criminal mischief and trespassing, according to the NYPD.\n\nAccording to the Daily News, which first reported the break-in, it wasn't Alvardo's first arrest at Swift's home. He was also reportedly arrested for trying to break into the Franklin Street townhouse with a shovel in February.\n\nAlvardo's arrest Friday marks the fourth time in three weeks a man had been cuffed at one of the \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" singer's properties.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Colorado man wearing a mask and rubber gloves was cuffed outside her home in Beverly Hills. In that instance, the man was arrested on stalking charges and had a knife, rope, ammunition, more masks and gloves and prescription drugs in the car. Swift wasn't home at the time.\n\nThat incident followed the April 8 arrest of a homeless man on suspicion of trespassing after he tried to climb a wall at the same property and ignored warnings by security guards to leave.\n\nAnd on April 4, authorities said a Connecticut man with a crush on the singer allegedly robbed a bank and went to her Rhode Island mansion and threw the money he stole over a fence in an attempt to impress her.",

    "content": "As the focus of this year\u2019s Comedy Central Roast, Bruce Willis was hit with repeated jabs about his age, his marriage, his Planet Hollywood business venture, his side music career and his recent string of less-than-spectacular films \u2014 and most of them came from the surprise appearance of ex-wife Demi Moore.\n\nSaying that she was \u201cmarried to Bruce for the first three \u2018Die Hard\u2019 movies, which makes sense because the last two sucked,\u201d Moore served as an impromptu roaster as she recounted memories of raising their three daughters, who were also in attendance, together.\n\n\u201cPeople wonder why our marriage came to an end, and in all honesty I think it was because some jealousy started to creep in. I think Bruce never really got over the fact that I rocked the bald look better than he did,\u201d Moore joked. \u201cAfter our divorce, he said he considered the end of our marriage his biggest failure, but Bruce, don\u2019t be so hard on yourself, you\u2019ve had much bigger failures. I mean Planet Hollywood, \u2018Hudson Hawk,\u2019 \u2018Striking Distance,\u2019 campaigning for Michael Dukakis, turning down Clooney\u2019s role in \u2018Ocean\u2019s Eleven\u2019 to focus on playing the harmonica?\u201d\n\nOn a more sentimental note, the actress, who was married to Willis for 12 years, said their marriage included \u201csome of the best times of my life,\u201d praising him as \u201ceasily one of my top three husbands.\u201d After the roast, Willis told reporters her performance was \u201cterrific\u2026very surprising and very cool,\u201d and he was just as shocked as the audience about her appearance.\n\nThe roast, recorded Saturday at the Hollywood Palladium, was led by Roast Master Joseph Gordon-Levitt, along with an assorted group of roasters, including Edward Norton, Cybill Shepherd, Jeff Ross, Martha Stewart, Lil Rel Howery, Dennis Rodman, Kevin Pollak, Nikki Glaser and Dom Irrera. Although still packed with burns on Willis and jokes against Donald Trump and Harvey Weinstein, the roast was more gentle and loving than most, with essentially all of the participants speaking on what the actor has meant to them.\n\nGordon-Levitt, who played a younger version of Willis in their film \u201cLooper,\u201d told Variety that Willis asked him personally to host, and when prepping the material he \u201cworked with the writers and said yes sometimes, said no a lot more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like \u2018That\u2019s not funny, that\u2019s not funny, that\u2019s not funny, that\u2019s pretty funny.\u2019 We\u2019re just trying to make each other laugh, I actually think that there\u2019s something cool about being able to laugh at yourself, not take things too seriously and I think it can be sort of cathartic,\u201d Gordon-Levitt said.\n\nNorton and Shepherd walked away as the big winners of the night, with Norton\u2019s bit focusing on how his and Willis\u2019 careers have differed, questioning, \u201cYou get away with everything. Can I cock my eye and say some cryptic s\u2014 that literally not one person in the room understands and have everyone laugh their asses off? I cannot.\u201d\n\nAfter continually trying to understand Willis\u2019 success (joking it was somehow in spite of poor scripts and repeatedly doing the same type of film), Norton reflected on working with him on a recent movie, saying, \u201cI love you, or maybe I\u2019m a very good actor and I\u2019m just acting when I say that. You wouldn\u2019t know the difference, and that\u2019s the reason I love you.\u201d\n\nShepherd, who starred alongside \u201cMoonlighting\u201d with Willis and infamously fought with the actor on the project, said she hadn\u2019t spoken to him in three decades but still agreed to be a roaster.\n\n\u201cOur characters on \u2018Moonlighting\u2019 weren\u2019t much of a stretch,\u201d she said. \u201cI played a former model, which I was, and he played an a\u2013hole, which he is\u2026 I know we haven\u2019t had a conversation in 30 years but we\u2019ll always have something more important: residuals.\u201d\n\nRodman, who attempted a pro-North Korea joke, was booed on stage, and Ross, who is also a co-executive producer on the show, arrived at the event dressed as Kim Jong-Un.\n\nAfter the taping, Ross said he \u201cfelt like this was a classier roast than we normally do. I thought it was pretty classy, he\u2019s a movie star we classed it up with tuxedos and Martha Stewart.\u201d\n\nWhen it came for his time to speak on stage, Willis said, \u201cIf you\u2019re a fan of Bruce Willis movies and I know you are, then you know how this works. I get the s\u2014 beat out of me for about an hour and a half, and then at the end I come back and whip everybody\u2019s a\u2013,\u201d proceeding to roast his roasters.\n\nHe ended by clarifying why he subjected himself to be the subject of a roast, which he said was to settle something once and for all: \u201c\u2018Die Hard\u2019 is not a Christmas movie. It\u2019s a god damn Bruce Willis movie!\u201d\n\nFollowing the event, Willis teased that he \u201cthought I dislocated my jaw because I was laughing so hard.\u201d\n\nBruce Willis closes out #BruceWillisRoast with a harmonica solo pic.twitter.com/BrzPQM0dhk \u2014 Kirsten Chuba (@KirstenChuba) July 15, 2018\n\nThe \u201cComedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis\u201d airs on the network July 29 at 10 p.m.",

    "content": "Kate Beckinsale is the latest woman to come forward with a story about Harvey Weinstein\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct, describing an incident from when the actress was just 17 years old.\n\nOn Thursday, Beckinsale posted a photo of her teenage self on Instagram with a caption recounting an alleged encounter between her and Weinstein. \u201cI was called to meet Harvey Weinstein at the Savoy Hotel when I was 17,\u201d she writes. \u201cI assumed it would be in a conference room which was very common.\u201d\n\nThe actress then describes behavior almost identical to that detailed by many other women who have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment or assault, and that appeared in the exposes written by The New York Times and The New Yorker. \u201cWhen I arrived reception told me to go to his room,\u201d Beckinsale continued. \u201cHe opened the door in his bathrobe. I was incredibly naive and young and it did not cross my mind that this older, unattractive man would expect me to have any sexual interest in him. After declining alcohol and announcing that I had school in the morning I left, uneasy but unscathed.\u201d\n\nBeckinsale then says Weinstein would later allude to the incident in question and subject her to verbal abuse over the years. \u201cA few years later he asked me if he had tried anything with me in that first meeting. I realized he couldn\u2019t remember if he had assaulted me or not,\u201d the actress wrote. \u201cI had what I thought were boundaries \u2014 I said no to him professionally many times over the years \u2014 some of which ended up with him screaming at me calling me a c*nt and making threats, some of which made him laughingly tell people oh \u2018Kate lives to say no to me.'\u201d\n\nBeckinsale continues her post by calling out Hollywood\u2019s culture of silence and complicity before applauding the women who have spoken out about their experiences with Weinstein. \u201cIt speaks to the status quo in this business that I was aware that standing up for myself and saying no to things, while it did allow me to feel uncompromised in myself, undoubtedly harmed my career and was never something I felt supported by anyone other than my family,\u201d she says. \u201cI would like to applaud the women who have come forward, and to pledge that we can from this create a new paradigm where producers, managers, executives and assistants and everyone who has in the past shrugged and said \u2018Well, that\u2019s just Harvey /Mr X/insert name here\u2019 will realize that we in numbers can affect real change. For every moment like this there have been thousands where a vulnerable person has confided outrageous unprofessional behavior and found they have no recourse, due to an atmosphere of fear that it seems almost everyone has been living in.\u201d\n\nThe actress concludes her account with a story about a friend she says tried to warn another woman about Weinstein. \u201cI had a male friend who, based on my experience, warned a young actress who said she was going to dinner with Harvey to be careful,\u201d she recounts. \u201cHe received a phone call the next day saying he would never work in another Miramax film; the girl was already sleeping with Harvey and had told him that my friend had warned her off. Let\u2019s stop allowing our young women to be sexual cannon fodder, and let\u2019s remember that Harvey is an emblem of a system that is sick, and that we have work to do.\u201d\n\nSince the publication of the stories in the Times and The New Yorker, other actresses have described experiences similar to Beckinsale\u2019s from early on in their career. They include Cara Delevigne, who says Weinstein invited her up to his hotel room, where there was another woman who attempted to kiss her at his behest, and Gwyneth Paltrow, who says the producer suggested \u201cthey head to the bedroom for massages\u201d when she was 22, after he cast her as the lead in Emma.\n\nAs the accusations continue to pile up against Weinstein, both the New York Police Department and the London police have begun investigations into the allegations, according to The Guardian. Meanwhile, Weinstein has announced his departure from Los Angeles to seek treatment in a rehabilitation center.\n\nRelated: How Tabloids Dragged Ambra Gutierrez Through the Mud After She Accused Harvey Weinstein of Groping Her\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s Rights Are Human Rights\u201d: 62 Fashion Insiders Speak Out in a Powerful Video for International Women\u2019s Day:",

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nIf you counted down the days until Going Clear aired or watched every episode of Leah Remini's takedown of Scientology, then you will likely fall into the void that is The Arrangement. Truthfully, I was hesitant to watch E!'s second scripted series after not being able to see the allure of The Royals, but my fascination with Scientology drew me into the series. The Arrangement - which premiered in 2017 - follows the relationship between aspiring actress Megan Morrison (Christine Evangelista) and Hollywood superstar Kyle West as Megan enters a contract marriage with him. Kyle is a coveted member of a self-help organisation called \"The Institute of The Higher Mind (IHM)\" led by Terence Anderson former Alias star Michael Vartan). As Megan - a very mediocre actress - gets more involved with Kyle, she is also coerced into making IHM a part of her life. The combination of allusions to Scientology and Ashlee Simpson's ex-boyfriend (Henderson) from her MTV reality series was enough to get me hooked.\n\nRecommended The Church of Scientology is launching its own TV network\n\nBefore the show premiered last March, rumours circulated that The Arrangement was actually inspired by Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise's marriage. Creator Jonathan Abrahams told THR that the team was \"inspired by rumours we have all heard.\" He said, \"If you and I took a minute, we could probably come up with 10 couples that we\u2019ve heard might be not real or might have been arranged. And, by the way, that goes back to the golden age of Hollywood.\" While Holmes and Cruise's marriage may not be the only inspiration for The Arrangement, it's hard to believe it didn't cross any of the team's minds. \"I\u2019m happy for people to think, 'Oh, this must be the Tom and Katie story.' But then they\u2019ll watch and realise it\u2019s not,\" Abrahams added.\n\nOf course, The Institute of The Higher Mind is not Scientology - it's formatted as a place where people are looking to improve their lives, not as a religion. It's supposed to give an inside look at how people may or may not be lured into these types of groups (i.e. AA, Lifespring or Landmark Forum), which is what makes the show interesting. However it's difficult to deny the Easter eggs within the show that allude to the aforementioned self-help groups, but also Scientology. When Megan first auditions for West's movie - which is actually an audition to be his wife - she is asked to deliver \"three imperatives.\" This is an IHM mind exercise and something that parallels tests that the Church gives their members. It's also impossible to deny the closeness of Anderson and West - a similarity to Cruise's relationship with friend and Scientology leader David Miscavige. As Megan becomes more involved with IHM, all media requests need to be approved by the organisation. In Scientology, members of the Church are only supposed to talk about their religion in Scientology-specific publications and can't talk about it if they leave it. The Church denies all claims made by former members. But perhaps one of the biggest allusions to the religion comes from Kyle's ex Lisbeth (Ashley Grace), who is paranoid about being followed and won't discuss her past with IHM. She left Kyle with no explanation other than a letter saying she was \"getting lost\" in his world. This is not too foreign from Cruise's divorce from Mimi Rogers or Nicole Kidman. In 2012, former Scientology executive Marty Rathburn told Vanity Fair that \"both women got cold on Miscavige\" and he was essentially \"integral to the breakup\" of their relationships.\n\nWhile the show does a deep dive into the idea of self-help groups and cult-like organisations, it also touches on the idea of Hollywood's fake relationships and contract marriages - appealing to people who enjoy blind item sites. Watching Megan go from struggling actress to leading lady is engaging, especially when the public wonders how certain stars get famous so quickly. The Arrangement also reveals the dark secrets that are rumoured to be hidden behind some of the most famous celebrities - it's evident that Kyle has an anger management problem and a past he's tried to leave behind.\n\nThis season focuses more on what happens when Megan actually gets fully immersed in the IHM experience as her wedding to Kyle looms.\n\nCome for the conspiracy theories and stay for Ashlee Simpson's ex-boyfriend.\n\nThe Arrangement airs at 9pm EST on E!",

So why did Javi and Briana break up? Bri said their futures \u201cdidn\u2019t line up,\u201d and that explanation would have been frustratingly vague if she had stopped there. But then Bri got much more specific, saying he didn\u2019t approve of her going under the knife.\n\n\u201cJavi and I are not together anymore,\u201d Briana told Blasting News in January. \u201cOur future just doesn\u2019t line up. He doesn\u2019t want me to get my surgery for a breast lift, lipo, and tummy tuck \u2026 because it\u2019ll look bad on his name at work. Also, I don\u2019t plan on moving in with him in the summer, and for these reasons, he broke up with me.\u201d\n\nBriana elaborated even further, adding, \u201cI have no bad things to say to about him. He wanted a wife and home right now, and I didn\u2019t see a reason to rush. I wish him the best going forward, and I am sad things panned out this way, but this is where things currently stand. Again, we are no longer together.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Javi\u2019s statement to Radar Online mostly corroborated Bri\u2019s version of events, though he did say the surgery itself \u201cwasn\u2019t the issue.\u201d He explained, \u201cSome questions about our futures couldn\u2019t be answered because we both do have kids and live two different lifestyles, her being in Florida and me in Delaware. I didn\u2019t agree with some of her future plans being exposed for the world to see for our future and any future employers, and I wish we could\u2019ve compromised. Maybe I was overthinking, but I couldn\u2019t figure out a way to answer some of those questions \u2026 Bri is an amazing person with the biggest heart I\u2019ve ever got to hold. Everything she goes through and she\u2019s still selfless and does her best to please others. She\u2019s got a bright future, and she\u2019ll make any guy feel special.\u201d\n\nAfter the breakup, fans thought Briana was pregnant with Javi\u2019s baby, but that speculation seems unfounded these days. In fact, Javi is about to be a father again now that new girlfriend Lauren Comeau is pregnant. And Bri is being gracious about that surprising news. \u201cI\u2019m happy for them,\u201d she told Us Weekly earlier this week. \u201cI wish them nothing but the best. All he wanted was a family, and he got it. So, good for him. Like I said, I\u2019m sending my best wishes and have no hard feelings.\u201d\n\nThe lady (and the Javi) doth protest too much, we think.

    "content": "What is Larsa Pippen's Net Worth?\n\nLarsa Pippen is an Assyrian-American former model, TV personality, and fashionista who has a net worth of $10 million. Larsa Pippen rose to fame as the star of the TV reality show The Real Housewives of Miami. Larsa Pippen earned additional fame through her modeling career. She is also well known as the ex-wife of NBA Super Star, Scottie Pippen.\n\nLarsa and Scottie married in 1997. They separated a number of times and officially divorced in 2021.\n\nEarly Life\n\nShe was born Larsa Younan on July 6, 1974, in Chicago, Illinois. She attended a local high school in Chicago where she was an average student. Pippen graduated from the University of Chicago where she obtained a degree in Political Science.\n\nCareer\n\nThe model and ex-wife of a former NBA star, Scottie Pippen, she earned a spot on the Bravo's reality series Housewives that debuted on February 22, 2011. She did not return for season two. A snarky beauty as she is, Larsa boasts that she is successful at everything she does, including playing the 24/7 role of a wife and mother of four. As she says, when she is not busy turning her three little boys into star athletes or shopping for her princess, Larsa is spending a little time on herself. Following her positive experience on the Housewives, it was announced that she and Scottie will star in their own reality series on WE tv, titled Big Pippen, slated for a 2013 debut. The woman once known as \"Hottest NBA Wife\" also made several appearances on Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, as Kim Kardashian's close friend. Larsa maintains a blog, \"Life with Larsa,\" and is a brand ambassador for Haute Living magazine. She also runs the Pippen Foundation, which raises money for various children's charities.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nLarsa and Scottie Pippen tied the knot in Chicago (sans prenup) on July 20, 1997, when Larsa was just 23 years old. She was thrust into the limelight immediately for being married to the NBA superstar. The couple has four children together: Scottie Pippen Jr., Preston Pippen, Justin Pippen, and Sophia Pippen. At least one of their kids got the basketball gene: Their oldest son Scottie Jr. is a point guard for Vanderbilt University and was on the 2020 All-SEC freshman team.\n\nThe couple announced their separation in 2016. Scottie Pippen decided to file for divorce from Larsa, which came shortly after cops were called to their home for the second time in the span of two days. The cops had been called to the couple's home in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida because of an alleged domestic disturbance.\n\nThe pair finally finalized their divorce in 2018 amid rumors that Larsa had cheated on Scottie with rapper Future, a rumor which she denies. Larsa made headlines in December 2020 when she was spotted with then-married NBA star Malik Beasley. The \"Real Housewives of Miami\" alum was photographed holding hands with the 24-year-old NBA player in Miami and the photos quickly surfaced after. Beasley's wife, Montana Yao, slammed him on social media and then filed for divorce.\n\nIn an awkward twist, in late 2022 Larsa began dating Marcus Jordan. In addition to being 17 years younger than Larsa, Marcus is also the son of Scottie's former Bulls teammate Michael Jordan.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 2004 Larsa and Scottie paid $2.225 million for a 10,000 square foot lakefront home in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park. They listed the home in 2016 for $3.1 million. Even after lowering the price to $1.899 million in 2019, they could not find a buyer.\n\nIn 2000 they paid $1.3 million for a property in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In 2004 they custom-built a 9,700 square foot, 6 bedroom mansion on the lot. In 2010 they listed the home for $16 million. A decade later they had still not found a buyer, even after lowing to just under $10 million. As of this writing, the property is still listed for sale for $12 million.",

Trust me. You'll cry. Khlo\u00e9's hit series following the weight loss journies of varying contestants is back, and the sneak peek is so, so emotional.\n\nI don't know, you guys. Blame it my own insecurities growing up as someone who could always stand to lose a few pounds. Blame it on the fact my literal job is to closely follow the Kardashians' lives which has created an inflated sense of personal connection to their family. Blame it on the fact I'm almost 30 years old and don't have anything besides cereal in my house as a source of nourishment... but this trailer really, really got me.\n\nHere's the premise of the show in a freaking nutshell. As you guys know, Khlo\u00e9 found fitness as a means to cope with her anxiety and take control of her life. Over the past few years, we've watched her totally transform into a freak-in-a-good-way workout fiend, and become a sculpted warrior. For her, it began around the time her marriage started to unravel with ex-husband Lamar Odom, resulting in what she now calls her \"revenge body.\"\n\nSounds like a hit TV show premise, right?\n\nRIGHT!\n\nIn the show, Khlo\u00e9 and a team of trainers help contestants get the body of their dreams as a way to combat the people and things in their lives that dragged them down in the past.\n\nIMBd summarizes,\n\nShe's [Khloe] giving them the chance to reinvent themselves from the inside out, with the help of a team of elite trainers, stylists and nutritionists. Each hourlong episode follows the participants' progress to transform their bodies and empower their confidence in 12 weeks, leading to final reveals and chances to defy those who doubted them.\n\nOK. Do you guys feel adequately prepared to watch the trailer now? Take a breath.\n\nHere you go.\n\nI'll give you a minute.\n\nWHICH IS YOUR FAVORITE PART? Is it when the dance instructor yells, \"Don't you want to prove your mom wrong?!\" Or when Khlo\u00e9 says it's not just about a hot body \u2013 it's about body, mind, and soul?? OR IS IT WHEN THE GUY DANCES IN THE SHOE STORE???\n\nFor me, it's when Khlo\u00e9 lets that lucky human touch her butt... not that this is about Khlo\u00e9's butt...\n\nBut also, can we be the most real for a second? Think back before KUWTK was a thing. How would you guys feel if you were a young 20-something girl and your sister was Kim Freaking Kardashian, the breakout sex-icon of your generation? Probably a little insecure, don't you think?\n\nKhlo\u00e9 explains in the trailer,\n\nMy entire life I've been compared to my sisters. I don't look like them. I was chubby and tall. I lost a lot of confidence in myself. I found new me in this happiness and I want to share it with other people.\n\nSing it, sister.\n\nThis season's contestants also are totally inspiring and have deeply touching and relatable pasts that somehow led them to Khlo\u00e9.\n\nIn the final moments of the trailer, we catch glimpses of body transformation reveals, people crying, and a quick shot of an engagement ring. I mean, this show packs personal inspiration, romance, AND a Kardashian... if that doesn't sound like your next favorite series, then Khlo\u00e9 and I literally can't help you.\n\nCheck out the entire Gen Why series and other videos on Facebook and the Bustle app across Apple TV, Roku, and Amazon Fire TV.",

    "content": "In 1969, a nun in Baltimore went missing. Two months later, her body was found. Her name was Sister Cathy Cesnik. She was a beloved 26-year-old teacher at the local Archbishop Keough High School, and her death left the community confounded: Who would want to hurt this woman? Decades later, the case is still unsolved\u2014but the circumstances around it have grown wild and complex, with police desperate to determine if Cesnik\u2019s death had anything to do with a major sexual abuse scandal at the school. What did she know? And who, ultimately, used that information against her?\n\nThe mysterious murder is coming to light this spring thanks to Netflix, which is releasing a seven-part docu-series about Cesnik\u2019s death titled The Keepers. A new trailer, released on People, is giving true-crime fans a first look at the series, and is already striking an ominous, conspiratorial tone.\n\nThe trailer\u2019s main action is led by locals who knew Sister Cathy, particularly two former students who have never stopped trying to solve the devastating murder. After Cesnik\u2019s death, many quickly linked her case to the alleged covered-up sexual-abuse scandal by priest Father Joseph Maskell, who was accused of sexually abusing dozens of school girls. He later paid settlements to his accusers, per People.\n\nBut two of the accusers, Jean Wehner and Teresa Lancaster, decided to participate in the Netflix documentary, directed by Ryan White. The series digs into the allegations, attempting to untangle the dark web Maskell\u2014whom White describes as a \u201csociopath\u201d\u2014allegedly weaved, and trying to bring to light all the insidious participants who helped him get away it.\n\n\u201cThis is a story of accountability and, at best, dozens of people and institutions dropped the ball and didn\u2019t protect children and adults,\u201d White tells People. \u201cAt worst, dozens of people and institutions covered things up so it could never be brought to light or were directly involved in crimes.\u201d\n\nHe adds that while many of the alleged perpetrators, including Maskell, died before being brought to justice, \u201cthere are people still alive who I do believe need to be held accountable.\u201d\n\nTrue-crime stories have always been at the forefront of pop culture, but there\u2019s been a boom in recent years, thanks to the explosive success of podcasts like Serial, HBO\u2019s series The Jinx, and Netflix\u2019s own Making a Murderer. However, retelling crime stories often presents a problem when it comes to finding a fitting ending. Serial, for example, had an amazing run, but ended on a \u201cYou be the judge\u201d note that left many grasping for a more concrete finale. But though White was never focused on solving the murder of Sister Cathy, he feels strongly that the ending of this docu-series, unlike many true crime stories before it, will be promising: \u201cI finished this project thinking this murder can be solved.\u201d",

She joked to Deadline.com that since splitting from Brad, it's up to her to step up.\n\n'I am now the breadwinner for the family so it\u2019s time,' the mother-of-six laughed as she spoke about returning to acting after a hiatus.\n\nThe industry site caught up with Angelina at the Telluride Film Festival over the weekend where she was showing her directorial debut and passion project First They Killed My Father.\n\nThe actress confirmed she will star in a follow-up to Disney's Maleficent released in 2014. 'We have been working on the script and this is going to be a really strong sequel,' she said.\n\nHappy days: Angelina pictured with daughter Vivienne at the Telluride Film Festival this past weekend, has been separated from husband Brad for a year and has primary custody of the kids\n\nBack to wicked: The actress said of returning to the Disney role she first played in 2014: 'We have been working on the script and this is going to be a really strong sequel'\n\nAngelina and Brad separated in September 2016 and Angelina took a year off from acting to concentrate on her personal situation and 'to take care' of her kids, she told THR.com during the festival in Colorado.\n\nShe also revealed to The Hollywood Reporter that she might also star in Cleopatra.\n\n'There is a script,' she said. 'There's a lot of different things floating around. But I haven't committed.'\n\nReady to get back to work: Angelina told The Hollywood Reporter during the festival that her one-year-break from the movies is over\n\nWhile promoting First They Killed My Father, the Oscar winner admitted that filing for divorce after a 12 year relationship has been difficult.\n\n'Sometimes maybe it appears I am pulling it all together. But really I am just trying to get through my days,' said the Tomb Raider vet.\n\n'I don\u2019t enjoy being single. It\u2019s not something I wanted,' she continued in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph.\n\n'There are no upsides, there's nothing nice about it. It's just hard,' she added.\n\nBetter times: Angelina split from Brad in September 2016. 'I don\u2019t enjoy being single. It\u2019s not something I wanted,' she told the Sunday Telegraph, (pictured 2015)\n\nNow a single mother, the Girl Interrupted star has endured a few years of physical pain as well as emotional.\n\nIn 2013, she underwent a preventive double mastectomy after it was revealed she carried the BRCA1 gene, which gave her an estimated 87 per cent risk of breast cancer and 50 per cent of ovarian cancer. She had her ovaries removed in 2015 as another preventative measure.\n\nAnd last year - in addition to hypertension - the superstar developed Bell\u2019s Palsy.\n\n'Emotionally it\u2019s been a very difficult year. And I have some other health issues. So my health is something I have to monitor,' she relayed.\n\n'I feel sometimes that my body has taken a hit, but I try to laugh as much as possible. Even if you are going through chemo, you need to find the ability to love and laugh.'",

Gossip Cop reports that an insider close to Swift confirmed she is not house-searching in England at all\u2014especially as she's about to set off on her Reputation world tour this spring.\n\nOriginal, 4/5, 5:35 p.m.: Taylor Swift, the pop star and very secretive girlfriend of British actor Joe Alwyn, is ready to commit! To England full-time, that is. The Sun's Dan Wootton\u2014the guy who broke the news the two were secretly dating last May\u2014reports that Swift is looking for a North London house to make her home base. Alwyn and his family live in North London's Crouch End; Swift would like to be near that and the countryside near Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, outside of the city. (Soho Farmhouse, by the way, is where Meghan Markle had her swanky bridal shower.)\n\n\u201cTaylor loves the UK and how she can live a relatively normal life without being disturbed,\" the source said. The Sun previously reported that Swift went undetected in disguises around the city. \u201cSetting down roots is something she\u2019s thought long and hard about. She\u2019s set aside \u00a330 million ($42 million) to find the house of her dreams, which she hopes to one day settle down in with Joe if their relationship continues to grow.\"\n\nThe leading requirement for this house is that it has multiple kitchens. \u201cTwo mega kitchens are an absolute requirement as she wants one near her entertaining area to be kept clean,\" the source continued. This is because Swift loves cooking oh-so much. Her passion for it is so intense, Alwyn reportedly calls her his \"feeder,\" per The Sun.\n\nThis isn't Swift's only property, of course. Swift has a penthouse apartment in New York City, a Beverly Hills house that's also a historic landmark, the Rhode Island beach house where she throws her Fourth of July parties, and a penthouse apartment in Nashville (plus a house there, too).\n\nPreviously, Swift rented a home in London, then started staying at Alwyn's so much that his friends joked \"it\u2019s as if she\u2019s moved in with him,\" a source told The Sun earlier this year.",

Winslet will be playing a character named \u201cRonal\u201d and it\u2019s unclear yet how many of the four planned sequels she will appear in or whether she\u2019ll even be human or Na\u2019vi. Well, at least we can all be sure Cameron knows how to shoot the Oscar winner in blue.\n\nWhen breaking the news, Cameron told Deadline: \u201cKate and I have been looking for something to do together for 20 years, since our collaboration on Titanic, which was one of the most rewarding of my career.\u201d But as any Winslet lover can tell you, their decades-long relationship hasn\u2019t exactly been smooth sailing. In 1998, when Winslet was making the press rounds for her Oscar-nominated work in Titanic (her second nomination after 1995\u2019s Sense and Sensibility) she famously told the L.A. Times: \u201cI would only work for Jim Cameron again for a lot of money.\u201d Winslet later told Rolling Stone that quote was misinterpreted, but even that magazine added that Winslet \u201crelated harrowing near-drownings, and lots and lots of yelling\u201d courtesy of her director.\n\nWhen asked in 2012 about Winslet\u2019s occasional Titanic complaints to the press, James Cameron told Moviefone: \u201cI have to cut her some slack on that . . . a good part of the success of the film was because of their great work and so now they\u2019ve had this sort of sense that there was a long shadow they had to escape from, so I understand her needing to distance herself from it. But, on the other hand, you know, it\u2019s been 16 years, like, come on, Kate. Get over it. Take the win, girl! [Laughs] It\u2019s O.K. You can relax now. You can unclench . . . I said I understood [her] response, I didn\u2019t necessarily agree with it.\u201d\n\nAnd that same year, when Winslet and Cameron walked the red carpet together at the premiere of Titanic\u2019s 3-D re-release in theaters, Winslet was eager to defend Cameron against reports that he had bullied her on the set. \u201cYes, he lost his temper,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut he only ever lost his temper for really, really good reasons.\u201d Winslet and Cameron have both said it was the actress\u2019s relationship with co-star (and lifelong friend) Leonardo DiCaprio that got her through the very rough shoot. \u201cDid Kate mention that they were really there for each other?\u201d Cameron told Rolling Stone in \u201998. \u201cOn a long shoot, especially as you get into, like, month five, you\u2019re just in a siege.\u201d\n\nThough both Winslet and Cameron now consider their Titanic feuds water under the bridge (or under the door?), Winslet still clearly carries some scars from that period in her life. At the time, Cameron dubbed the actress \u201cKate Weighs-a-Lot\u201d and just earlier this year, Winslet gave an impassioned speech on body image and bullying which concluded: \u201cI learned to embrace my flaws, to make no apology for who I am. I dug deep and I decided that I simply wouldn\u2019t listen when they said my body didn\u2019t fit. This is who I am, the real me, Kate from Reading.\u201d",

And unfortunately it has backfired on us \u2026 Although it\u2019s awful to say we can\u2019t make ourselves look as attractive as possible without being knocked down and raped.\u201d\n\nAngela Lansbury and Morgan Fairchild in an episode of \"Murder, She Wrote.\" everett digital\n\nLansbury was speaking about the wave of sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations made recently against such powerful men as Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.\n\nHer comments went viral, and not in a good way.\n\nSome people said they thought the beloved \u201cMurder, She Wrote\u201d actress, 92, was trending because she was deceased but were mortified to hear what she said.\n\nOthers pointed out the irony of the actress playing a mystery writer and amateur detective who advocated for victims in \u201cMurder, She Wrote,\u201d the long-running CBS show.\n\nPeople also noted the irony of her part in \u201cGaslight,\u201d a 1944 film that helped popularized the term \u201cgaslighting,\u201d a form of psychological abuse in which someone is manipulated into questioning their sanity.\n\nAngela Lansbury, star of the 1944 version of Gaslight, which gave us the term \u2018Gaslighting\u2019, has just declared that attractive women share the blame for sexual harassment. pic.twitter.com/x3ruL22cIR \u2014 Dr Fern Riddell (@FernRiddell) November 28, 2017\n\nIn the interview, Lansbury goes on to explain that women shouldn\u2019t be prepared to be sexually assaulted because \u201cthere\u2019s no excuse for that.\u201d\n\nSome have excused the 92-year-old\u2019s comments by saying, \u201cshe\u2019s from a different time.\u201d Others say her age is no excuse.\n\nOn Wednesday, Lansbury released the following statement about the reaction to her earlier comments:\n\n\u201cI am troubled by how quickly and brutishly some have taken my comments out of context and attempted to blame my generation, my age, or my mindset, without having read the entirety of what I said. There is no excuse whatsoever for men to harass women in an abusive sexual manner. And, I am devastated that anyone should deem me capable of thinking otherwise.\n\n\u201cThose who have known the quality of my work and the many public statements I have made over the course of my life, must know, that I am a strong supporter of women\u2019s rights.\u201d",

He was assessed a flagrant-2 on the play.\n\nInstead of leaving the court and going to the locker room, however, Thompson was at the center of a scrum during which he shoved the basketball in the face of Warriors forward Draymond Green.\n\nWhen asked what led tempers to flare, Thompson said Warriors guard Shaun Livingston took an unnecessary shot (NSFW language):\n\nThat confrontation caught the eye of Los Angeles Clippers guard Patrick Beverley:\n\nThompson had a quiet game to open the series. The 6'9\", 238-pound big man posted just two points on 1-of-4 shooting while grabbing five rebounds. He recorded a plus/minus of minus-nine in 20 minutes.\n\nAlthough he did not make an impact in Game 1, Thompson may be a key to victory for Cleveland. When the Cavs won their first-ever championship in 2016, Thompson was a force in the paint, averaging 10.3 points and 10.1 rebounds per game in the Finals.",

    "content": "When you're a celebrity, throwing caution to the wind and posting every second of your life \u00e0 la Kardashian is a valid life choice, but some look at that approach and turn 180 degrees the opposite way. Saturday Night Live star Kate McKinnon is one of those people.\n\nThe Emmy winner is famously private, giving few details about her personal life and even fewer about her romantic life. We know she's not one to talk about dating, we know she's gay, and we know she told GQ in a cover story that she's the antithesis of an over-sharer.\n\n\"I get criticized by people who know me the best for not sharing enough details about my day or my life. I am just quite an insular person, I guess,\" she said.\n\n\"I just\u2026 I decided in my mid-20s that I didn't feel comfortable sharing personal details like I had in the previous few years. And I just have run with that ever since.\"\n\nFor all intents and purposes, she's continuing to run that way now, though we do know a little bit more than before. As of last year, she was dating an actress named Jackie Abbott. Here's what you should know about McKinnon's girlfriend ahead of the 2018 Emmys, where we've got our fingers crossed for a red carpet couple debut.\n\nBruce Glikas\n\n1. McKinnon and Abbott stepped out as a couple at the 2017 Emmys.\n\nBut not on the red carpet (dang). Abbott sat next to McKinnon in the audience, and when the SNL star won the award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, she and Abbott embraced.\n\nIt was the most primetime camera moment the two shared all night.\n\n2. Like McKinnon, Abbott is a performer.\n\nShe's an actor living in New York City with an IMDb page all to herself, so clearly, she and McKinnon have a lot in common. Past credits of hers include \"Murder, My Tweet\" and \"Miss Sugar Tit,\" which were both short films.\n\n3. We only know McKinnon and Abbott definitely dating because of Michelle Visage from RuPaul's Drag Race.\n\nWhile the couple kept it low-key in front of the main cameras at the Emmys, McKinnon felt more comfortable hamming it up with friends from RuPaul's Drag Race. And that's how their relationship was confirmed.\n\nIn a caption on the photo, Drag Race judge Michelle Visage gave a shout-out to McKinnon and \"her girlfriend, Jackie.\"\n\n4. Abbott is also a part-time clown.\n\nWhile McKinnon clowns around on TV, Abbott apparently does it for real. Her website says she's a photographer and clown and lists \"clowning\" as one of her skills.\n\n5. Like McKinnon, personal social media accounts aren't Abbott's favorite.\n\nNeither McKinnon nor Abbott seems to have a trace of personal social media accounts out on the internet. Bummer.",

    "content": "We may have come full circle to the aughts when it comes to fashion trends, but one reunion that won\u2019t be happening anytime soon is between Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan. One month after Hilton revealed that Lohan will not be invited to her upcoming wedding with Chris Zylka, explaining \u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all,\u201d Hilton has become more specific about her issues with Lohan.\n\nThe heiress called the actress a \u201cpathological liar\u201d on Instagram after the fan account @paris2000s posted a few old videos of Lohan talking about their relationship. The videos, taken in 2006, show Lohan exhibiting conflicting feelings about Hilton. In one clip, Lohan says, \u201cThis is a video that Paris Hilton\u2026 and I\u2019m saying this on tape\u2026 she hit me last night, for no reason, apparently at my friend\u2019s house and I didn\u2019t know she\u2019d be there. She hit me; she hit me with a drink and poured it all over me and it hurts and it\u2019s not okay.\u201d\n\nIn another video, though, the pair are still together. As Hilton is getting into a car, she shouts at Lohan who is approaching the vehicle, \u201cLindsay, tell them the truth,\u201d to which Lohan replies, \u201cParis is my friend,\u201d Lohan says, \u201cShe\u2019s a nice person. Please leave us alone\u2026she never did that, she\u2019s a good girl.\u201d\n\nThen, in another clip, Lohan calls Paris a \u201cc-nt,\u201d before a friend of her whispers something to the actress and Lohan clarifies her stance, saying, \u201cI never said that. Paris is my friend. I love her. I\u2019ve known her since I was 15 years old.\u201d\n\nHilton left her own opinion in the comments section of the video, which was posted with the caption, \u201cThe chronicles of the \u201900s troubled star Lindsay Lohan and her chaotic backtracking situations,\u201d writing, simply, \u201c#pathologicalliar.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that 2006 was the year Lohan and Hilton\u2019s rumored feud began, after a video of Hilton laughing at their mutual friend Brandon Davis calling the actress a \u201cfire crotch\u201d went viral. Last month, Hilton clarified their current relationship status, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t have any drama with anyone but I choose to not surround myself with certain people. Life is too short.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Instagram\n\nLohan is more or less attempting to do the same as she has stepped away from the spotlight to work on a film with an all-female team in Saudi Arabia. (She\u2019s currently based in Dubai.) Lohan recently reflected on how much life has changed since the aughts, telling W, \u201cIt\u2019s [called] an iPhone. We didn\u2019t have Instagram.\u2026 It would have been a lot calmer for me. When you think about it, paparazzi are not as crazy as they used to be when I used to be in New York. Now I can just [take a picture] before I walk out the door and then there is no story. It\u2019s good, but it\u2019s a little in-genuine.\u201d One thing about that does seem to be genuine: her and Hilton\u2019s feud.\n\nRelated: Reintroducing Lindsay Lohan: The Actress Has Found a Sense of Calm, and Is Now Ready to Launch a Beauty Brand",

And yes, it is Oct. 20.\n\nInspiration for the video, of course, comes from Disney\u2019s Oscar-winning animated film, \u201cZootopia,\u201d directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore, and featuring the spot-on voice work from Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin.\n\nIn the actual film, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) has only 48 hours to crack her first case, so she turns to scam-artist fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) for help. Their investigation takes them to the local DMV (Department of Mammal Vehicles), which is staffed entirely by sloths.\n\nThe new video finds several young customers giggling and pointing out neat quirks about the sloths \u2014 which struggle with paperwork and pressing the button to take driver\u2019s license photos.\n\nWhen one younger child tells his dad, \u201cI think it\u2019s a sloth,\u201d the dad responds, \u201cWhat\u2019s a sloth?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does he have a computer? How does he use the cup?\u201d the same youngster asks, befuddled.\n\n\u201cDo you have a supervisor?\u201d one customer asks.\n\nHuman DMV-goers are shocked to find themselves being assisted by slow-moving sloths in an \u201cOh My Disney\u201d clip, which was inspired by Disney\u2019s Oscar-winning feature \u201cZootopia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhenever you get a chance, just make this update,\u201d one tells the sloth, eyeing paperwork that will never be completed.\n\n\u201cHe looked like he was scratching his butt,\u201d an amused young customer announces.\n\nThe video then springs into serious customer confusion as the sloths attempt to take license photos.\n\nNear the end, the sloths take their allotted breaks.\n\nA sign reads, \u201cBreak Time! Attendant Will Return At:\u201d However, the paper\u2019s just covered in scrawls.\n\nIn the closing seconds, the sloths use their \u201cinterspecies bathroom\u201d and munch on some grub in the break room.\n\nThe \u201cOh My Disney\u201d videos essentially put real-life Disney scenarios to the test.

She was 47.\n\n\u201cThe news of her death destroyed our life and we will never be the same,\u201d said her father, John Nesci, in a statement read during Reagan\u2019s sentencing in Torrance Superior Court. \u201cAll of a sudden, in the dark of the night, everything was stolen from her and from all of us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNesci was an avid body builder whose show followed her life as a tough, hardworking attorney in the Riviera Village. Her young son, Rocco, was featured in several episodes.\n\nA statement written for the sentencing by Robert Nesci, the victim\u2019s brother, described a troubled relationship between the couple \u2014 one that Nesci was allegedly preparing to leave.\n\n\u201cShe wasted years of her life, gifted you with so much money, and foolishly believed in your stories,\u201d he wrote.\n\nReagan was \u201cdistraught\u201d when he called police to the home in 2015 to report an emergency, said Redondo police Sgt. Fabian Saucedo.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of weird actually. He didn\u2019t say anything. It\u2019s one of those things we call an unknown trouble call,\u201d Saucedo said at the time. \u201cIt was very vague, like, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d\n\nPolice automatically respond to 911 calls, so they drove by Nesci\u2019s home \u2014 where Reagan waited outside, Saucedo said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe gave them details of what may have occurred, and as a result, [the officers] decided they better go in and check the welfare. That\u2019s where they found the body,\u201d Saucedo said at the time. \u201cObviously it was some kind of domestic dispute; otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t have led to this.\u201d\n\nAfter police discovered Nesci\u2019s body, Reagan was arrested.\n\nHis defense attorney contended in court that the stabbing was in self-defense and that Nesci fell on the knife during a struggle.\n\nAn autopsy revealed that Nesci was stabbed at least four times in the abdomen between her breasts and belly button. Reagan waited more than five hours after the stabbing to call police, contacting an attorney first.\n\nA native of Connecticut, Nesci joined the Los Angeles Police Department in 1996 and worked as a patrol officer in the Southwest Division, according to a biography on her website. An LAPD spokeswoman declined to confirm that Nesci was a former employee, citing privacy issues.\n\nNesci said she was among the officers present during the North Hollywood shootout in 1997.\n\nHer career with the LAPD was brief. She left the department in 1998 and enrolled in law school at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn. In 2004, she returned to California and melded her legal career with pursuits in entertainment and media, including hosting a radio show on KCAA-AM (1050).\n\nesmeralda.bermudez@latimes.com\n\n@LATBermudez",

All of the kids chose to pin their yellow flowers to their jackets except for Jolie and Zahara, who gorgeously tied theirs in their hair.\n\nJolie and the family are, as always, absolutely stunning.

They\u2019ve previously reported that Rob wasn\u2019t Dream\u2019s father and that Chyna was pregnant with his second child. Both of those stories have been debunked. With MTO\u2019s less than stellar record, it\u2019s easy to question the truthfulness of their story about which parent currently has legal custody of Dream Kardashian.\n\nGossip Cop says that they looked into the story and found that it was untrue. Sources close to both Chyna and Rob confirm that Dream Kardashian does spend more time with Rob, but that isn\u2019t because her mother has given up legal custody.\n\nThe reason that Dream is with Rob more could be that Chyna is the parent who works and makes more money than Rob. TMZ reports that court documents filed in their custody negotiations reveal that Chyna is the breadwinner in this situation. Her money comes from hosting gigs and club appearances. Rob has little other income other than what\u2019s derived from his family\u2019s reality TV show. According to TMZ, those checks are chump change compared to what Chyna rakes in on a regular basis.\n\nChyna is set to make even more bread if reports that she could be getting a record deal turn out to be true. HipHopDX reports that the former King Of Diamonds stripper wants to follow in the footsteps of Cardi B to become a dancer turned rapper. She\u2019s reportedly met with executives at Capitol Records among other labels.\n\nDo you think that Blac Chyna will get a record deal?

    "content": "Story highlights Raisman says she was sexually abused by Nassar, including at the London Olympics Separately, Jacob Moore is the first male gymnast to join a federal suit against Nassar\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nOlympic gold-winning gymnast Aly Raisman has filed a lawsuit against the US Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics, disgraced doctor Larry Nassar and others, alleging the committee at its highest levels was aware that Nassar had molested gymnasts who participated with USA Gymnastics.\n\nThe suit was filed Wednesday in Santa Clara County Superior Court in California.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Nassar, the former doctor for Michigan State University athletics and the national gymnastics team, sexually abused Raisman at the Karolyi Ranch in Texas, national and international competitions and the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nRaisman is a two-time Olympian who won medals in London and Rio de Janeiro, including team gold in each of those Games.\n\n\u201cMy highest priority has been to push for change, so future generations of athletes will be safer,\u201d Raisman said in a statement. \u201cIt has become painfully clear that these organizations have no intention of properly addressing this problem. After all this time, they remain unwilling to conduct a full investigation, and without a solid understanding of how this happened, it is delusional to think sufficient changes can be implemented.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, thousands of young athletes continue to train and compete every day in this same broken system. I refuse to wait any longer for these organizations to do the right thing. It is my hope that the legal process will hold them accountable and enable the change that is so desperately needed.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Raisman\u2019s attorney, John Manly, accused the USOC and USA Gymnastics of \u201ca conspiracy to silence victims and cover up the largest child sex abuse scandal in history.\u201d\n\n\u201cA simple fact is this: If USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee had followed their own bylaws, policies and procedures designed to protect children from sexual abuse, Ms. Raisman never would have met him, never would have been \u2018treated\u2019 by him and never would have been molested by him,\u201d Manly said.\n\n\u201cInstead they conspired to hide their knowledge of Nassar\u2019s horrible crimes from the public and attempted to frighten Ms. Raisman and other victims into keeping quiet. USOC and USAG can and will be made accountable by our justice system.\u201d\n\nUSA Gymnastics declined to comment on Raisman\u2019s lawsuit Friday but offered support to athletes who have been abused by Nassar. \u201cUSA Gymnastics is committed to doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again by making bold decisions and holding ourselves to the highest standards of care,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nCNN also reached out to the US Olympic Committee for comment. Previously, USA Gymnastics, the Olympic Committee and Michigan State have denied wrongdoing in the Nassar scandal.\n\nThe US Olympic Committee announced Wednesday that CEO Scott Blackmun is stepping down for health reasons. In late January, the entire membership of the USA Gymnastics board of directors resigned, as required by the USOC in a move to improve the organization and provide a safe environment for gymnasts.\n\nUSA Gymnastics terminated its agreement with the Karolyi Ranch in January. Marta and Bela Karolyi, longtime gymnastics coaches for Team USA, are retired.\n\nNassar, 54, pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges and 10 counts of criminal sexual conduct in two state court cases in Michigan. He\u2019s in prison in Tucson, Arizona, serving a 60-year sentence for the federal charges.\n\nIf he\u2019s still alive when he finishes his federal sentence, Nassar will have to return to Michigan to serve sentences for sex crimes. He was sentenced to 40 to 125 years in Eaton County, Michigan, where nearly 200 girls and women made statements about how his sexual abuse had changed their lives.\n\nThat sentence will run concurrently with the 40- to 175-year sentence from nearby Ingham County. In the latter case, Nassar pleaded guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct \u2013 three of which involved victims under age 13 \u2013 and admitted to using his stature as a medical professional to assault and molest girls under the guise of medical treatment.\n\nFirst male gymnast joins suit against Nassar\n\nSeparately, the first male gymnast has joined a civil federal suit against Nassar and others associated with the sex abuse scandal of the former Michigan State and USA Gymnastics doctor.\n\nFiled Wednesday, the complaint alleges Jacob Moore was treated multiple times by Nassar in a Twistars gym, at the Michigan State University Sports Medicine Clinic and in Nassar\u2019s home. It was there, according to the suit, that Nassar \u201cpulled down Plaintiff Jacob Moore\u2019s pants, exposing his genitalia, explaining to Jacob Moore that he was doing this to treat his shoulder pain through acupuncture in his pubic area and in and around his genitalia.\u201d\n\nMoore was a minor at the time, and this was done after another minor female gymnast came into the basement where he was being treated, the suit says.\n\n\u201cThere is no known medical connection between shoulder pain which can be treated through acupuncture in the area of a male\u2019s genitalia,\u201d the suit says. \u201cPlaintiff Jacob Moore believes the conduct of Dr. Nassar was sexual assault, battery, abuse, molestation and harassment performed by Defendant Nassar for Defendant Nassar\u2019s sexual pleasure and gratification.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s sister, Kamerin, a member of USA Gymnastics from 2003-2014, first testified about her and her brother\u2019s victimization during Nassar\u2019s criminal trial in Ingham County in January. She also joined the federal civil suit.\n\nJacob Moore has been a member of USA Gymnastics since 2006 and trained at the Twistars gym from 2001 through 2015.\n\nThe allegations were made in an amended civil federal complaint filed against Nassar. Defendants include Michigan State, the university\u2019s board of trustees, USA Gymnastics and others associated with the scandal. USA Gymnastics also declined to comment on Moore\u2019s complaint.\n\nThe suit, which has several other plaintiffs, seeks declaratory, injunctive, equitable and monetary relief for injuries.",

But their divorce still isn\u2019t final, a new report says, because they still haven\u2019t agreed to terms about their six children. It has been almost two years since Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie announced their split.(Shutterstock)\n\nAccording to E! News, Jolie is resentful of Pitt for essentially locking her down in Los Angeles, because he\u2019s chosen a film that will be shot in LA to be near his kids. Jolie, meanwhile, had planned on taking them to Europe. \u201cBrad is opposed to that and is blocking it from happening. Brad will be filming in LA for the summer and wants to see the kids on his regular custody schedule,\u201d a source told E.\n\nWrap up the year gone by & gear up for 2024 with HT! Click here\n\nHe currently sees his children - Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne - a few times a week. Jolie, according to the report, is \u2018furious\u2019 at the situation.\n\nBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie split in September 2016. (Shutterstock)\n\nJolie recently took Shiloh and Zahara to Jordan to visit a refugee camp in January, and later travelled to Paris with all of her children. \u201cAngelina has been in London and is free to travel for shorter periods of time,\u201d the source says. \u201cBrad isn\u2019t opposed to that. But she can\u2019t leave with the kids for several months.\u201d\n\nJolie had initially filed for sole physical custody of the kids, but in November 2016, Pitt filed for joint custody. By December, they\u2019d reached a temporary agreement, after the FBI concluded their investigation of Pitt regarding an alleged incident of child abuse on a private plane. No charges were filed and Pitt was cleared.\n\nPitt opened up about the custody battle in his 2017 interview to GQ Style, his first since the split. \u201cI was really on my back and chained to a system when Child Services was called,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you know, after that, we\u2019ve been able to work together to sort this out.

Oscars 2017: 10 things you need to know, from the epic mix-up to Viola Davis\u2019s speech A few hours after Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty announced \u201cLa La Land\u201d as best picture at the Academy Awards (when the trophy actually belonged to \u201cMoonlight\u201d), PricewaterhouseCoopers, the longtime accounting firm in charge of the Oscar ballots, took responsibility and released an apology statement. Dunaway and Beatty were apparently given the envelope and card for the best actress category, which read \u201cEmma Stone, \u2018La La Land.\u2019 \u201d Thus, the confusion.\n\nWatch the crazy ending of the Oscars (Video: Clip Courtesy A.M.P.A.S.\u00a9 2017)\n\n\u201cThe presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected,\u201d the statement read in part. \u201cWe are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOkay. Sure. But social media had other ideas: What if it wasn\u2019t just a simple mix-up? On ABC\u2019s official Oscars \u201cAfter Party\u201d special, before there was more information, host Anthony Anderson also seemed convinced it was all a conspiracy. Here are some of the theories floated in the early hours of Monday morning:\n\n1. This was an especially mean prank from Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nThe late-night host is famous for his practical jokes, from his YouTube hoaxes (the twerking girl on fire, the wolf at the Sochi Olympics); to urging parents to pretend they ate their kids\u2019 Halloween candy; to his holiday prank war with his neighbors, John Krasinski and Emily Blunt. So \u2026 couldn\u2019t this just be a way to make his Oscars gig really, really memorable?\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Leqsee/status/836100391314075649\n\n@jimmykimmel that was a really mean prank - to both La La Land and Moonlight. \u2014 Charlie Roxbee (@CharlieRoxbee) February 27, 2017\n\nthis was kimmel's best prank tbh \u2014 Lana Berry (@Lana) February 27, 2017\n\n2. It\u2019s all Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s fault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome eagle-eyed viewers noticed that Leonardo DiCaprio, who announced best actress, didn\u2019t give Stone her card when she won. Uh oh \u2014 could he be responsible?\n\nLater, Stone said she was in possession of the card; which is actually plausible, as there are two cards printed for each category. Either way, time for some suspicions about DiCaprio\u2019s role in this madness.\n\nLEO CARRIED THAT CARD OFFSTAGE PUT IT DOWN WHEN HE SAW WARREN AND WARREN PICKED IT UP\n\nHey, maybe Leonardo DiCaprio laid the Best Actress card on top of the Best Picture card while walking off stage? It's his fault. #Moonlight \u2014 MoonBlossom (@MoZone) February 27, 2017\n\n3. This was a prank from Matt Damon on Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThroughout the entire ceremony, Kimmel mercilessly teased Damon, extending their years-long \u201cfeud.\u201d Toward the end of the show, the announcer referred to Damon as Ben Affleck\u2019s \u201cguest\u201d when they presented an award, and music played over Damon when he started talking. So it looked like Kimmel got the last laugh \u2026 or did he?\n\nTheory: Did Matt Damon prank Jimmy Kimmel by giving the wrong envelope to Beatty?

She still has it.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for twigs had no comment on the matter.\n\nPattinson, 31, and twigs, 29, were first photographed hanging out together with friends in 2014 \u2014 fueling rumors of a romance. Just a few months later, the relationship was undeniable when the Twilight star arrived at the singer\u2019s first sold-out concert with a beautiful bouquet of roses.\n\nThe pair were a private couple, keeping a low profile for most of their time together. Their first official public appearance was in late 2016 at the LA Dance Annual Gala.\n\nPattinson popped the question in 2015 \u2014 and the news of their engagement accidentally slipped to the press by rapper T-Pain, who told Vulture the musician may not contribute to his new album because \u201cshe\u2019s engaged now.\u201d\n\nSources later confirmed to PEOPLE that the engagement was real \u2014 but in August 2015, insiders revealed to PEOPLE the wedding had been postponed. By November of 2016, Pattinson feigned confusion when asked how planning was going for their pending nuptials, telling PEOPLE, \u201cPlanning what now?\u201d\n\nIn late July, Pattinson said that he and twigs were \u201ckind of\u201d engaged during an interview on Howard Stern\u2019s Sirius-XM show \u2014 adding that \u201cshe\u2019s amazing\u201d and \u201csuper talented.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by GQ if he was getting married in an interview for the September cover, Pattinson responded with a noncommittal \u201ceh.\u201d\n\nPrior to his relationship with twigs, Patterson dated Kristen Stewart.\n\nHe made headlines in August when he was spotted having dinner in Los Angeles with Katy Perry and a group of friends \u2014 though a source close to theactor told PEOPLE the two were \u201cjust friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re super cuddly always,\u201d the insider said. \u201cThey\u2019ve known each other forever.\u201d",

    "content": "The actor Minnie Driver has told the Guardian that men \u201csimply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level\u201d and should not therefore attempt to differentiate or explain sexual misconduct against women.\n\nDriver was discussing comments by Matt Damon, whom she once dated and with whom she starred in the Oscar-winning 1997 film Good Will Hunting. In an interview with ABC News this week, Damon said alleged sexual misconduct by powerful men involved \u201ca spectrum of behaviour\u201d.\n\nDamon said there was \u201ca difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviours need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn\u2019t be conflated.\u201d\n\nHe added that society was in a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d and said it was \u201cwonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories and it\u2019s totally necessary\u201d. But he said: \u201cWe live in this culture of outrage and injury, that we\u2019re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, \u2018Wait a minute. None of us came here perfect.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn her first response to Damon, Driver wrote on Twitter: \u201cGod God, seriously?\n\n\u201cGosh it\u2019s so interesting (profoundly unsurprising) how men with all these opinions about women\u2019s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem.\u201d\n\nDriver\u2019s response to Damon was shared widely on social media, alongside that of the actor Alyssa Milano, who said: \u201cThere are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it\u2019s still cancer.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Driver told the Guardian: \u201cI felt I desperately needed to say something. I\u2019ve realised that most men, good men, the men that I love, there is a cut-off in their ability to understand. They simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level.\n\n\u201cI honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can\u2019t tell a woman about their abuse. A man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it\u2019s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.\u201d\n\nDriver\u2019s comments come more than two months into a radical national reappraisal of gender relations begun by accusations against Harvey Weinstein, an executive producer of Good Will Hunting who denies allegations including sexual assault and rape.\n\nSpeaking to ABC, Damon compared allegations against Weinstein, Al Franken, Kevin Spacey and the comedian Louis CK, whom he commended for his remorseful response.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the sign of somebody who \u2013 well, we can work with that,\u201d Damon said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t know Louis CK. I\u2019ve never met him. I\u2019m a fan of his, but I don\u2019t imagine he\u2019s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he\u2019s paid at this point is so beyond anything ... \u201d\n\nDriver said that as accusations, suspensions and firings first swept through Hollywood, she initially refrained from comment. She was now moved to expand her initial response to Damon.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why Matt would defend Louis CK,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems to me that he thinks that because he didn\u2019t rape somebody \u2013 so far as we know \u2013 that what he did do wasn\u2019t as bad.\u201d\n\nThe comedian was accused of misconduct including masturbating in front of a number of women. In response, he said \u201cthese stories are true\u201d but did not specifically apologise.\n\nMatt Damon attends a screening in New York. Photograph: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a problem,\u201d Driver continued. \u201cIf good men like Matt Damon are thinking like that then we\u2019re in a lot of fucking trouble. We need good intelligent men to say this is all bad across the board, condemn it all and start again.\u201d\n\nDriver argued that men should not be granted the power to interpret abuse inflicted on women without the risk of redoubling an injustice they can scarcely understand.\n\n\u201cI felt that what Matt Damon was saying was an Orwellian idea, we are all equal except that some us are more equal than others,\u201d she said. \u201cPut abuse in there \u2026 that all abuse is equal but some is worse.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThere is no hierarchy of abuse \u2013 that if a woman is raped [it] is much worse than if woman has a penis exposed to her that she didn\u2019t want or ask for \u2026 you cannot tell those women that one is supposed to feel worse than the other.\n\n\u201cAnd it certainly can\u2019t be prescribed by a man. The idea of tone deafness is the idea there [is] no equivalency.\n\n\u201cHow about: it\u2019s all fucking wrong and it\u2019s all bad, and until you start seeing it under one umbrella it\u2019s not your job to compartmentalise or judge what is worse and what is not. Let women do the speaking up right now. The time right now is for men just to listen and not have an opinion about it for once.\u201d\n\nSince the first publication of allegations against Weinstein, a number of women have come forward to detail abuse they have suffered. This week, the actor Salma Hayek wrote a long essay for the New York Times about her treatment by Weinstein.\n\n\u201cThere is not a woman I know,\u201d Driver said, \u201cmyself included, who has not experienced verbal abuse and sexual epithets their whole fucking life, right up to being manhandled and having my career threatened several times by men I wouldn\u2019t sleep with.\u201d\n\nDriver did not elaborate on the persons or circumstances involved. But she expressed optimism that as the culture of harassment and abuse that has existed is exposed, men will find a way to support women.\n\n\u201cIn the same stereotypical way that we see women being supportive of men in their endeavors,\u201d she said, \u201cI feel that\u2019s what women need of men in this moment. They need men to lean on and not question.\n\n\u201cMen can rally and they can support, but I don\u2019t think its appropriate, per se, for men to have an opinion about how women should be metabolising abuse. Ever.\u201d\n\n",

And yes, it is Oct. 20.\n\nInspiration for the video, of course, comes from Disney\u2019s Oscar-winning animated film, \u201cZootopia,\u201d directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore, and featuring the spot-on voice work from Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin.\n\nIn the actual film, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) has only 48 hours to crack her first case, so she turns to scam-artist fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) for help. Their investigation takes them to the local DMV (Department of Mammal Vehicles), which is staffed entirely by sloths.\n\nThe new video finds several young customers giggling and pointing out neat quirks about the sloths \u2014 which struggle with paperwork and pressing the button to take driver\u2019s license photos.\n\nWhen one younger child tells his dad, \u201cI think it\u2019s a sloth,\u201d the dad responds, \u201cWhat\u2019s a sloth?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does he have a computer? How does he use the cup?\u201d the same youngster asks, befuddled.\n\n\u201cDo you have a supervisor?\u201d one customer asks.\n\nHuman DMV-goers are shocked to find themselves being assisted by slow-moving sloths in an \u201cOh My Disney\u201d clip, which was inspired by Disney\u2019s Oscar-winning feature \u201cZootopia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhenever you get a chance, just make this update,\u201d one tells the sloth, eyeing paperwork that will never be completed.\n\n\u201cHe looked like he was scratching his butt,\u201d an amused young customer announces.\n\nThe video then springs into serious customer confusion as the sloths attempt to take license photos.\n\nNear the end, the sloths take their allotted breaks.\n\nA sign reads, \u201cBreak Time! Attendant Will Return At:\u201d However, the paper\u2019s just covered in scrawls.\n\nIn the closing seconds, the sloths use their \u201cinterspecies bathroom\u201d and munch on some grub in the break room.\n\nThe \u201cOh My Disney\u201d videos essentially put real-life Disney scenarios to the test.

    "content": "Last week, Starbucks introduced the limited-time-only Unicorn Frappuccino, and the interwebs went bonkers. The creation was served only through April 23, but coffee drinkers weren't quite ready to let go. Enter the unofficial Starbucks \"Dragon Frappuccino.\" If you were bummed to see the Unicorn Frapp make its exit (I mean, who wasn't?), you might just love this twist on beverages inspired by mythological creatures.\n\nThe Dragon Frappuccino isn't an official menu item, according to a Starbucks spokesperson. Rather, it appears to be a brilliant idea on the part of some creative baristas. Its existence is possible due to the virtually endless customization you can employ when ordering your favorite Sbux drinks. \"In addition to the beverage options listed on our menu boards, there are more than 170,000 ways baristas can customize beverages at Starbucks, including selecting from a variety of milks, syrups, coffee/espresso options, and toppings,\" a Starbucks spokesperson tells Bustle. \"This high level of personalization allows our customers to tailor their drink to match their personal taste preferences.\" The Dragon Frappuccino seems to have been born from this \"anything goes\" philosophy, and people are loving it.\n\nThe Unicorn Frappuccino originally came with a stipulation on its availability: You could get it from April 19 through April 23, or as long as supplies lasted. Indeed, it ended up being so popular (because, I mean, look at it) that the \"as long as supplies last\" part proved to be a key factor. Some locations did in fact run out of the ingredients before the April 23 deadline. So someone, somewhere got inventive and came up with what we now call the Dragon Frapp. As one Instagram user put it when attempting to order the Unicorn Frappuccino, \"They were out of the ingredients and offered me something not only cooler and better tasting, but easier to make: The Dragon Frappuccino.\"\n\nWhile I honestly don't know for sure what's in the Dragon Frappuccino, one customer said on Instagram that it was a green tea Frapp with some vanilla bean powder and \"berry cup swirl.\" The consensus seems to be that the Dragon Frapp is a little less sweet than the Unicorn Frapp.\n\nHowever, if you want to order one, you'll have to get creative. Says a Starbucks spokesperson to Bustle, \"If customers want to order a beverage that is not listed on our menu boards, we recommend they know the recipe so that their barista can handcraft the beverage perfectly for them.\" So in other words, don't go to a Starbucks, try to order a \"Dragon Frappuccino,\" and expect your barista to know what you mean. Instead, your best bet is to tell the barista that you want a Green Tea Frappuccino with vanilla bean powder blended up into it and a berry swirl in the cup. Once you've got that perfectly customized drink in your hand, you can call it whatever the heck you want \u2014 just have pity on your poor barista and don't order an item by a random name that they'll likely have no idea about.\n\nWhile the Dragon Frappuccino may be less labor-intensive than its unicorn counterpart, it's possible that the swirly purple ingredient is left over from Starbucks unicorn days \u2014 meaning there might be a limited supply. (However, this hasn't been confirmed by anyone, so just take it as speculation on my part.) In other words, enjoy the Dragon Frappuccino while you can, folks, because it might peace out eventually.\n\nIt might not be quite as popular as the Unicorn Frapp, but you've got to admit that the Dragon Frapp is still a creative take on the coffee giant's trademark drink. One can only imagine what they'll think of next. (Mermaid Frapp? Fairy Frapp? Loch Ness Monster Frapp? Just throwing those out there...)",

Sonja Morgan's red dress fell off as she dances on stage at her co-star LuAnn De Lesseps' cabaret show in Manhattan on Thursday night\n\nDailyMailTV's Alicia Quarles helped her back into the unruly garment afterwards.\n\nThere to watch as she struggled with the slippery red garment were the other Housewives; Dorinda Medley, Ramona Singer, Tinsley Mortimer, Bethenny Frankel and Carole Radziwill.\n\nThey weren't the only stars in attendance; Saturday Night Live's Rachel Dratch dazzled onstage as she joined LuAnn for a number as did Scissor Sisters' Jake Shears.\n\nOn with the show! After a quick fix on stage, Sonja pushed on with her enthusiastic singing and dancing\n\nThe fun didn't stop there. After securing her dress back on, the 54-year-old socialite and reality TV star flashed the audience a glimpse of her derriere\n\nLuAnn, whose show it was, was more composed in a glittering green jumpsuit which stayed firmly in place\n\nSonja's faux pas came when she copied LuAnn who had bent over to let someone in the audience sing along into her microphone\n\nStar of the night: LuAnn, 52, dazzled in a parade of glittering gowns and jumpsuits\n\nThe cabaret show, named Countess and Friends in honor of the title LuAnn's first marriage afforded her, was her first return to the spotlight since her embarrassing Christmas Eve arrest and subsequent court dates.\n\nOn December 24, she was arrested for assaulting an officer in Palm Beach during a drunken rampage.\n\nIt was the culmination of months of heartache and humiliation at the hands of her second husband, the philandering Tom D'Agostino.\n\nThere to watch were the ladies' Real Housewives co-stars (L-R) Tinsley Mortimer, Dorinda Medley, Carole Radziwill, Ramona Singer and Bethenny Frankel who remained seated to film her pals as the others danced and cheered\n\nThe other ladies danced away but Skinny Girl founder Bethenny remained seated\n\nBethenny got up for another song and danced away solo while the other women watched\n\nSonja appeared to be having her own party and frolicked on the floor while the others remained seated\n\nLuAnn (center) was joined on stage throughout the night by Saturday Night Live's Rachel Dratch (front in black) and the Scissor Sisters' Jake Shears (not pictured). Also there was comedian Bridget Everett (far left in blue) and Broadway's Tony Yazbeck (far right)\n\nScissor Sisters star Jake Shears also gave a performance. He is currently in the Broadway production Kinky Boots\n\nShe tried to pull the same skirt move again, but instead of giving a coquettish peek at her legs Sonja ended up whipping off her whole ensemble to reveal a glimpse of her black panties and nude bra beneath.\n\nIt appeared to be unplanned as the starlet quickly grabbed her garment and covered her figure.\n\nMistake or not, the crowds were thrilled, hooting and hollering in response.\n\nOne of the audience members was none-other than Instagram pro The Fat Jewish.\n\nInstagram sensation The Fat Jewish heralded the performance as hope for a 2020 Luann De Lesseps presidential run\n\nNight to remember!

    "content": "The first season of E!\u2019s Hollywood relationship drama \u201cThe Arrangement\u201d ended with Megan (Christine Evangelista) emerging from the Institute of the Higher Mind presumably \u201creprogrammed\u201d but actually just faking it and instead vowing to \u201cburn it down.\u201d When the show returns for its second season, Megan will still want to keep up the ruse so she can keep her relationship with Kyle (Josh Henderson), but that relationship is going to get a lot more complicated.\n\n\u201cOne of the lines we\u2019re exploring this season is when you\u2019re coming from a place of anger and revenge, how sustainable is that?,\u201d creator Jonathan Abrahams tells Variety. \u201cIt\u2019s so much about emotion and passion in that world, and there\u2019s so much emotion and passion between Megan and Kyle, but how sustainable is that? For a while that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s worth fighting for, but then you have to ask if you can ever get back to that.\u201d\n\nWhile Megan and Kyle are moving forward in their relationship \u2014 and contract \u2014 by planning a wedding, Evangelista says the \u201choneymoon phase\u201d of their relationship is over, and now they are faced with questions of trust and whether or not the fantasy can withstand time.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of whose vision this wedding truly is, given that it was just one of many milestones she promised to mark when she signed the relationship agreement in the first place.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Megan\u2019s vision, it\u2019s not Kyle\u2019s vision, it\u2019s something else,\u201d Evangelista says. \u201cThere\u2019s always this other force around them, so it\u2019s this young girl having incredible moments, something she\u2019s fantasized about her whole life, and it\u2019s out of her control in a lot of ways. It\u2019s very stressful, and coming into this season the stakes are very high but the consequences are even higher.\u201d\n\nA throughline for the season, says Evangelista, is whether or not Megan and Kyle\u2019s relationship is strong enough to convince him of the truth behind the Institute, and Henderson points out that Kyle \u201creally wants the relationship to survive\u201d because he \u201ctruly does love Megan.\u201d\n\nBut further complicating things is the fact that Megan and Kyle are also embarking upon a professional project together \u2014 a movie she will star in that he will direct. Because it\u2019s the first project Kyle is directing \u201cit\u2019s a big deal for him, so he kind of obsesses about it,\u201d says Henderson.\n\nThe show\u2019s second season will also explore who Kyle was in the past to understand more about him, including his relationship with Lisbeth (Ashley Hinshaw) and Terrence (Michael Vartan).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a deep dive into Kyle West,\u201d Abrahams says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to learn a lot, not just about Kyle but also Terrence and their relationship \u2014 so much more of why his life has the strange elements in it that it does.\u201d\n\nHenderson adds that in getting to know Kyle, the audience will see \u201che\u2019s got a lot of guilt\u201d and \u201cdemons\u201d that he\u2019s trying to work through.\n\n\u201cHe wants to be happy and right some wrongs, and he\u2019s tired of hiding things. He and Megan have some pretty eye-opening, groundbreaking moments between them, and it\u2019s a big journey for him this year to decide if Terrence and the Institute really have his best interest at heart and if it\u2019s the best thing for him,\u201d Henderson says.\n\nKyle has had his own doubts about the organization, he says, but thus far he has needed it because of his \u201cintense\u201d relationship with Terrence.\n\nBut as the couple marches toward their marriage, they will be re-evaluating the other relationships they see around them. \u201cThere\u2019s a cool episode where we juxtapose the relationship [between Megan and Kyle, and Terrence and Deann] because they\u2019re both arrangements in a way, but they\u2019re in very different places,\u201d Abrahams says.\n\nMegan and Kyle may even have to re-evaluate their own relationship beyond the professional obligation they made to each other, says Henderson. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of separation. There\u2019s a lot of stuff going on with her, obviously, there\u2019s a lot of stuff with me, and then we come back at the end of the day and we\u2019re living together and there\u2019s this interesting, kind of weird dynamic between us because there\u2019s so many things not being said,\u201d Henderson says.\n\n\u201cThe Arrangement\u201d Season 2 premieres March 11 on E!",

    "content": "Theresa and Larry Caputo have been the marital anchor of Long Island Medium throughout its seven-year run. But now nearly a year after they announced their split and with Season 13 looming, it's not entirely clear where they stand. Or, for that matter, how much Larry Caputo will be on Long Island Medium.\n\nA preview for the upcoming episodes does feature Larry, so viewers can expect him to be featured in at least some capacity. How frequently he'll be around, however, is a different story. According to People, the Caputos officially separated in 2017 after 28 years of marriage, and after raising two now-grown children together. It was a shocking reveal for many of the show's fans, who thought the pair were unshakable, though their issues had certainly been covered in the past.\n\n\"After 28 years of marriage, we have decided to legally separate,\" their joint statement read, per People. \"We will always love each other and our two wonderful children. We are united in supporting each other and our family. Please respect our privacy during this time.\u201d\n\nThe clip certainly makes it seem like they're no longer seeing a lot of each other; Before the meet-up featured in the preview, Theresa says she hasn't seen her ex-husband in about nine months. TLC also posted a video on the network's official Twitter account, found below, teasing more of the sit-down the former couple shares.\n\nWhether Theresa and Larry will address all the intimate details of their breakup remains to be seen, but the medium says in the video that their relationship \"just wasn't working.\"\n\nAnd in yet another trailer released by TLC, Theresa and Larry shared more insight about how tough the decision was for both of them. \"Naturally I [spoke] with my children, and I know this is hard for them,\" Larry said before breaking down crying. Added an equally tearful Theresa: \"The hardest thing I have to do is move forward, and do it without Larry.\"\n\nLarry also provided an update to TMZ in late June, telling the website that they were going ahead with a divorce. \"The separation was a three-month trial period and we've moved on from that point. We're in divorce proceedings so that's been going on for the past six months,\" he said. \"It's not finalized. I don't know when it will be but that's where we're at. I'm doing fine. I know she's doing well. I'm happy. We've moved on with our lives.\"\n\nIt's clear that this wasn't an easy decision for either of them, but unfortunately, sometimes things just aren't meant to be. Those looking for a little more closure will be able to start recovering alongside the Caputos once Long Island Medium returns. Even if Larry is scarce from here on out, he and Theresa's history isn't being swept under the rug, and hopefully this will allow them and their fans to move forward together. After the issue is addressed on the show, all that'll be left to do is look to the future.",

Meghan McCain is the daughter of late United States Senator and former presidential candidate John McCain and businesswoman Cindy McCain. She first gained attention with her blog, \"McCain Blogette,\" in 2007, and she began writing for \"The Daily Beast,\" a website devoted to pop culture and politics, in 2009. McCain served as a co-host on the Fox News talk show \"Outnumbered\" from 2016 to 2017, and she joined ABC's \"The View\" as a co-host in October 2017.\n\nMeghan has earned three Daytime Emmy nominations with her \"The View\" co-hosts: two for Outstanding Entertainment Talk Show Host and one for Outstanding Informative Talk Show Host. McCain signed a six-figure deal with Hyperion Books in 2009 and published \"Dirty Sexy Politics\" the following year. She also released \"My Dad, John McCain\" in 2008 and \"America, You Sexy Bitch: A Love Letter to Freedom\" (which she co-wrote with comedian Michael Ian Black) in 2012. In July 2021 Megan announced she was stepping down from \"The View.\"\n\nEarly Life\n\nMeghan McCain was born Meghan Marguerite McCain on October 23, 1984, in Phoenix, Arizona. She grew up with father John, mother Cindy, and younger siblings John IV, James, and Bridget (who was adopted by the family after Cindy visited a Bangladeshi orphanage). Meghan studied at Phoenix Country Day School and Xavier College Preparatory before attending Columbia College of Columbia University. McCain graduated with a bachelor's degree in art history in 2007 and interned at \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"Newsweek.\"\n\nCareer\n\nIn 2007, Meghan began documenting John's presidential campaign on \"McCain Blogette,\" as well as writing about pop culture and fashion. In September 2008, she released \"My Dad, John McCain,\" a children's book about her dad's military service and presidential aspirations. The book became a bestseller, and a portion of the proceeds were donated to the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund. Meghan began contributing to \"The Daily Beast\" in early 2009, and the following year, she released her political memoir \"Dirty Sexy Politics.\" Around this time, she also began appearing on \"The View\" as a guest co-host.\n\nIn 2011, McCain and Michael Ian Black spent a month traveling across America in an RV, leading to the book \"America, You Sexy Bitch: A Love Letter to Freedom.\" That year, she also began appearing as an analyst on MSNBC, and in 2013, she got her own talk show, \"Raising McCain,\" on the Pivot channel. The show ran from September 2013 until January 2014, then Meghan joined Pivot's \"TakePart Live\" in May.\n\nIn July 2015, McCain became a Fox News contributor, and she began regularly co-hosting \"Outnumbered\" on the network in November 2016. In 2015, she played herself on an episode of the Showtime series \"House of Lies,\" and she was named a permanent co-host of \"The View\" in September 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, audiobook platform Audible announced that Meghan would be writing and narrating an audiobook about conservatism to be released as an Audible Original.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nMeghan married writer Ben Domenech on November 21, 2017, at her family Sedona ranch. The couple welcomed daughter Liberty on September 28, 2020. In July 2019, McCain revealed that she had previously suffered a miscarriage and wrote about the tragic experience in a \"New York Times\" piece entitled \"What I Learned From My Miscarriage.\" Meghan was very close to her father, and sadly, Senator McCain passed away from brain cancer in 2018; in her eulogy, McCain called her father's death the \"passing of American greatness.\"\n\nMeghan registered as an independent at the age of 18, and though she changed her political affiliation to Republican in 2008, she is supportive of gay rights and in favor of same-sex marriage. In 2014, GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) appointed McCain to their National Board of Directors, and she was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Talk Show Episode for \"Raising McCain.\" In 2019, she was honored with the Harvey Milk Foundation Lilla Watson Medal for her work as an LGBT rights advocate, and in 2015, she co-hosted the Concert for Love and Acceptance, a charity event put on by GLAAD and country singer Ty Herndon in Nashville.",

According to a source, the pop star made the call on his own after much consideration. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a decision made overnight,\u201d says an insider. \u201cHe\u2019s had some time off and was able to consider his commitments.\u201d To cancel the remainder of the tour, which was headed to Asia (Japan, Hong Kong, Philippines and Singapore) in addition to more U.S. dates (including an Aug. 5 performance at the Rose Bowl), was doable seeing as some tickets went on sale as recently as one week ago, so refunds will be available quickly.\n\nBieber\u2019s 14 called off dates follow a similar move by Adele, who canceled the last two shows of her world tour scheduled for London\u2019s Wembley Stadium, where 100,000 fans were expected nightly. \u201cOn medical advice I simply am unable to perform over the weekend,\u201d she wrote in a post on Facebook. \u201cTo say I\u2019m heart broken would be a complete understatement.\u201d\n\nBieber has not yet commented on social media and reps for the singer were also unavailable for comment.\n\nThrough the first half of 2017, Bieber\u2019s tour grossed $93.2 million with average per date ticket sales of 38,297, according to concert industry trade Pollstar. Bieber will likely face penalties for the U.S. dates, which are typically not insured against cancellation without a medical reason or a \u201cForce Majeure,\u201d which is defined as an unforeseeable circumstance that prevents someone from fulfilling a contract \u2014 like a war or political instability that could put an artist in danger.\n\nA source confirms TMZ\u2019s earlier story that Bieber was \u201cjust over it.\u201d A reporter for the site caught up with Bieber on the beach in Santa Monica, California Monday afternoon. Bieber responded to questions by saying \u201cEverything\u2019s fine \u2026 I\u2019ve been on tour for two years, [I\u2019m going to spend time] resting, relaxation gonna ride some bikes.\u201d Asked whether he had a message for his fans, he said \u201cI love you guys, you\u2019re awesome, I\u2019m sorry for anyone who feels disappointed or betrayed.\u201d\n\nUpdate: A statement announcing the cancellation read:\n\n\u201cDue to unforeseen circumstances, Justin Bieber will cancel the remainder of the Purpose World Tour concerts. Justin loves his fans and hates to disappoint them. He thanks his fans for the incredible experience of the Purpose World Tour over last 18 months. He is grateful and honored to have shared that experience with his cast and crew for over 150 successful shows across six continents during this run. However, after careful consideration, he has decided he will not be performing any further dates. Tickets will be refunded at point of purchase.\u201d",

And being the couple of the moment, things are no different for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry.\n\nPretty much as soon as the pair got wed and became the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, there was talk of their imminent plans to start a family. All it took was for Meghan to turn up to a family wedding in a billowing Oscar de la Renta dress for onlookers to start speculating whether the couple had already got started.\n\nBut you can hold your horses right now, because the Duchess isn't pregnant, there's a photo that as good as proves it, and they probably want at least five minutes to sit down and relax before they start planning parenthood, thank you very much.\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn a picture taken yesterday in Dublin, when Meghan and Harry attended a Summer Party at the British Ambassador in Ireland's residence at Glencairn House, the latest addition-by-marriage to the Royal Family can very clearly be seen drinking champagne. And while a glass or two isn't deemed any great issue for pregnant women, we can't imagine hitting the booze would be the first thing on Meg's list to do in the early stages of pregnancy.\n\nThat's not to say the pair don't intend on having children at some point in the future, however. Did you see the look Harry gave Meghan during their wedding vows when the Reverend said: \"[Marriage] is given as the foundation of family life in which children are born and nurtured\". Harry turned to his bride with biggest grin, which Meghan enthusiastically reciprocated.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAnd the couple have also hinted in public that they very much plan to start a family. Back in March, on the couple's last official visit to Ireland - then in Belfast, Northern Ireland - Meghan greeted an entrepreneur who makes baby products by saying: \"I\u2019m sure at some point we\u2019ll need the whole thing.\"\n\nIn the Duke and Duchess' post-engagement interview with the BBC back in November 2017, the subject was also brought up. Harry said they definitely planned to have children, just \"not yet\".\n\n\"I think eventually, one step at a time...we'll start a family in the near future,\" Harry said.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAnd of course, we can't forget Meghan's dad's thoughts on his daughter becoming a mother herself someday. In an interview with Good Morning Britain last month, Thomas Markle told Piers Morgan and Susannah Reid that Meghan has \"wanted children for a long time.\n\n\"When she met Harry and she spoke about how much she loves him... there\u2019s got to be a child in the making there soon,\" he said.\n\nSo it's safe to say - yes - if all goes well, Meghan and Harry will be producing beautiful royal babies. Just not right this second, okay?\n\nCheers to that Getty Images\n\nBut here's what they might look like if and when they do, because we couldn't resist.\n\nRelated Story Why Meghan and Harry's kids may not get a title",

Erin Lindsay, was faced with moving to New York for an undercover assignment with the FBI\u2019s counter-terrorism unit in order to protect her troubled mother, Bunny (Markie Post), who had become embroiled in a murder investigation.\n\nThe potential job change also came just as Lindsay\u2019s on-and-off boyfriend, Det. Jay Halstead (Jesse Lee Soffer), was thinking about proposing.\n\nOffscreen, this is the latest change for Chicago P.D., which also recently saw the departure of series regular Jon Seda, who moved to Chicago Justice, as well as the exit of co-creator and showrunner Matt Olmstead, who left for a lucrative overall deal with ABC Studios.\n\nIn addition to Olmstead, executive producers Michael Brandt and Mark Tinker also left at the end of season four. Rick Eid, who most recently served as showrunner of Law and Order: SVU, will take over as showrunner for Chicago P.D\u2018s upcoming fifth season, where it will hit its 100th episode.\n\n(It also remains to be seen if Seda will return to Chicago P.D. following Chicago Justice\u2018s cancellation earlier this week.)\n\nBush was one of several actors brought onto Chicago P.D. after the backdoor pilot was shown as a season one episode of Chicago Fire. Bush, as well as Soffer and Patrick John Flueger, were brought onto the Dick Wolf procedural after starring together in NBC\u2019s Hatfields & McCoys pilot, which was not picked up to series.\n\nLike Chicago Fire, which has written out at least five series regulars in as many seasons, Chicago P.D. has also not shied away from mixing up the core ensemble. Archie Kao\u2019s character was killed off the show at the end of season one, and Brian Geraghty departed at the end of season three.\n\nThis past season saw Chicago P.D. welcome several new recurring faces for multi-episode arcs, including Quantico alum Li Jun Li, Revenge grad Nick Wechsler, NYPD Blue alum Esai Morales and, most recently, former Revolution star Tracy Spiridakos, who was introduced in the final episodes of the season as a new member of the Intelligence Unit, temporarily taking over for Marina Squerciati\u2019s Burgess. (In real life, Squerciati was on maternity leave and is expected to return for season five.)\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t start off at the beginning of this season with a big whiteboard like, who can we move out? Who can we move in? But we certainly wanted to be this season, as you do every season, ready for anything,\u201d Olmstead told The Hollywood Reporter in January. \u201c[We thought], \u2018Let\u2019s be light on our feet. If there is any change, whether long-term or short-term, let\u2019s embrace it and use it as an opportunity for storytelling and conflict.'\u201d\n\nIn addition to Chicago P.D., Bush appeared multiple times on the other Chicago shows as well as Law and Order: SVU. Her starring role on Chicago P.D. followed a nine-season run on One Tree Hill, and her other credits include Nip/Tuck and John Tucker Must Die. Bush next appears in the Bruce Willis film Acts of Violence.",

    "content": "Ellentube\n\nThe always adorable Jennifer Garner continued to make us fall in love with her while co-hosting a Mother's Day episode of \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" on Thursday.\n\nThe bubbly actress, who's most important role in life is playing mom to three kids she shares with Ben Affleck, opened up about her pregnancy experiences, sang and rapped mom advice in a cute music video, did farm animal impressions, gave away lots of free stuff and, of course, got scared in signature Ellen fashion.\n\nEnjoy all of the highlights below.\n\nPregnancy Talk\n\nThe actress spent the interview portion gushing about her kids and dishing on her own pregnancy experience -- including one inept doctor telling her a baby growing in her womb didn't exist -- before giving the audience full of pregnant women some words of wisdom about what to expect while expecting.\n\n\"Here's the thing you guys. You will get your bodies back,\" Garner promised. \"You will get your lives back. You can still travel. You can still have fun. You can still go back to work, or not. You can breastfeed or not. You will be best friends with your kid, and then someday you're going to realize you're actually angry with them, and that's OK. And you're going to be great, because it's your experience, and it's your baby and it's your body and it's your body and it's going to happen the way you want it to when you're starting your families. It's going to be beautiful.\"\n\nMom Advice Music Video\n\nGarner loves being a mom so much she wrote a song and made a cheesy music video full of advice for \"all the pregnant ladies at 'The Ellen Show.'\"\n\n\"Imagine squeezing something about the size of a watermelon/ how much pain is that? There'll be a lot of swellin,'\" Garner rapped. \"And breastfeeding? It ain't simple/ one false move, you've got a cracked nipple.\"\n\nThe mom rap is, perhaps, even more charming than that time Garner dressed up in full marching-band gear to play Reese Witherspoon \"Happy Birthday\" on the saxophone.\n\nFarm Animal Noises\n\n\"You know how you're always telling me you do really great impressions of farm animals?\" Ellen asked her co-host, who responded with a firm, \"No.\"\n\n\"Yeah, just go with this,\" Ellen instructed Garner before asking for a pig, horse and goat impression.\n\n\"You're such a jerk,\" Garner said while laughing.\n\nIt was a goofy set up to introduce Once Upon a Farm, a company Garner co-founded to make fresh, organic baby food that can be found in the refrigerated section of grocery stores across the country.\n\nMother's Day Scare\n\nWhat \"Ellen\" episode would be complete without a guest nearly having a heart attack on the air? Despite the wholesome theme, the comedian squeezed in a scare while Garner was busy describing all of the free gifts the audience was getting.",

The actress announced she was diagnosed with breast cancer in September, a few days after she won her sixth consecutive Emmy for her portrayal of Selina Meyer in Veep. HBO subsequently halted production on the comedy series while Louis-Dreyfus received treatment; the show will resume filming in August, and the new episodes will air in 2019.\n\nLater in the program, Veep won the award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. Actor Tony Hale sang Louis-Dreyfus\u2019 praises in the press room backstage, saying, \u201cWhoever\u2019s No. 1 on the call sheet sets the tone, and she has set the tone that we\u2019re all part of the team. No one is walking around on egg shells. We can all throw in jokes. It really creates this environment that\u2019s a family. And she\u2019s a really good cook. She makes a really good key lime pie. We miss her greatly. We wish she were here, big time.\u201d\n\nAfter Veep\u2018s win, the actress tweeted, \u201cI wish I could have been @SAGawards tonight but have to admit it\u2019s pretty fun to watch in my pj\u2019s. So honored to win. So proud to be a union member. So happy for my @VeepHBO bozos for winning ensemble award. Miss being at the table with you all. How was the chicken?\u201d\n\nLouis-Dreyfus\u2019 SAG Award Sunday night is her third overall win for the part. She previously won the award twice for her role as Elaine Benes on Seinfeld. Additionally, she has won three comedy ensemble awards for Seinfeld.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus beat out Alison Brie (GLOW), Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin (Grace and Frankie), and Uzo Aduba (Orange Is the New Black)for the award.\n\nWith reporting by Maureen Lee Lenker.",
